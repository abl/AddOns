<h1>A brief history of Pawn</h1>

<p>
	I got tired of the version history section of the <a href="Readme.htm">
	readme</a> being longer than the rest of it, so I moved parts here.</p>
<h2>Future versions</h2>
<p>There are many features that I&#39;d like to add in future versions of Pawn, 
besides fixing issues listed in the &quot;known issues&quot; below.&nbsp; 
However, since Pawn's usefulness in 6.0 and later seems fairly limited, it's 
likely that Pawn may not receive any further major features.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It turns out that a bunch of low-level items, including the plate 
	tanking heirlooms, still use Dodge and Parry, so they get (?) icons now that 
	those stats were removed from Pawn.&nbsp; I may put the translations for 
	Dodge and Parry back into Pawn and just ignore those stats, or treat them as 
	Stamina.&nbsp; That would be different from what I do with stats like Fire 
	Resistance, but Dodge and Parry seem more prevalent than those. </li>
	<li>I'd like to make it so that Pawn only shows scales for your current 
	specialization by default.&nbsp; Most people don't care to see all three (or 
	four) of their scales and don't know how to turn them off.<ul>
		<li>At the same time I do this I will probably add some tech so that 
		instead of this...<br />
		Monk: brewmaster<br />
		Monk: mistweaver<br />
		Monk: windwalker<br />
		...a monk with mistweaver and windwalker as her specs would see this...<br />
		(<span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Symbol';">➕</span>) Mistweaver<br />
		(<span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Symbol';">🔪</span>) Windwalker</li>
		<li>I'd probably want to have a per-character checkbox at the bottom of 
		the scale list, "Pick scales for me".&nbsp; It automatically turns off 
		if you shift-click a scale.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I'd like to make it so that when tooltip scale values are turned off 
	(the default), in addition to your current best items and upgrades, Pawn can 
	optionally also show you sidegrades (items that are not identical to your 
	current best item but are within 1% of its value), and downgrades (items 
	with values that are only about 5% lower).&nbsp; For example:<ul>
		<li><span style="color: #8ec3e6;">Shaman: enhancement:</span>&nbsp;
		<span style="color: #808080;">sidegrade</span></li>
		<li><span style="color: #8ec3e6;">Shaman: enhancement:</span>&nbsp;
		<span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Symbol';">
		<span style="color: #808080;">⬇</span> -4% downgrade</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The item upgrade features work just on item IDs, but that means they 
	don't work well with random stat items since most of those have no stats on 
	the base version of the item and the "of the Beast" part is basically an 
	enchantment.&nbsp; 
	(I should probably store what Pawn calls unenchanted item links, which would still have the 
	random stat component.)</li>
	<li>I can add more upgrade arrows to more places, like your own inventory.&nbsp; 
	(The main reason I haven't done this already is that I was worried about the 
	performance implications.)</li>
	<li>I could add the upgrade arrow icon to the icon that Pawn adds 
	to the left of item link windows.</li>
	<li>I should add a feature so that warriors with Crazed Berserker (aka Titan&#39;s Grip) can have their 
	two best two-handed weapons tracked for upgrades instead of just one.</li>
	<li>For specs that have different DPS values for main hand weapons and 
	off-hand weapons, one-handed weapons should have two separate values, and 
	should use those different values when determining upgrades.&nbsp; (This is 
	a pretty big change though, and it might only really affect rogues.)</li>
	<li>WoW now has an API that didn't exist when Pawn was created: 
	GetItemStats.&nbsp; Using it could drastically speed up Pawn's calculations, 
	reduce complexity of the code, and make it much easier to translate.&nbsp; 
	I'd like to use it someday.&nbsp; It has these drawbacks though:<ul>
		<li>It can't get information about socket bonuses (no longer terribly 
		relevant in 6.0)</li>
		<li>It can't get information about which gems and enchantments are on 
		the item (no longer terribly relevant in 6.0)</li>
		<li>It can't tell things like whether the item scales with your level, 
		grants XP, or things like that (I might be able to work around that by 
		just maintaining a list of all item IDs of heirlooms)</li>
		<li>It can't tell the difference between the raid finder version of an 
		item and the mythic version of an item (verified September 24, 2014)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To make Pawn more approachable for new users, I think that by default 
	I'll remove Pawn values from trinkets (since trinkets have secondary effects 
	and thus their Pawn values are very rarely accurate).&nbsp; (Of course I'd add an option to turn 
	those values back 
	on.)</li>
	<li>I could improve the Compare tab to support comparing multiple sets of 
	items at once.&nbsp; For example, an entire gear set versus another person&#39;s 
	entire gear set.&nbsp; Or, at the very least, a dagger and an off-hand 
	versus a staff.</li>
	<li>There could be a way to automatically share Pawn scale 
	tags with another player through an in-game whisper.&nbsp; Something like 
	/pawn share Vger &lt;scale name&gt;.&nbsp; Or, there could just be a window 
	where you could type another player&#39;s name to see their Pawn scales if they 
	use Pawn... sort of like a Scalesteal spell.</li>
	<li>I&#39;d love to integrate with AtlasLoot&#39;s Wish List feature, helping you 
	find and manage upgrades to your items.</li>
	<li>It would be neat to have a way to let people create scales just by 
	sorting stats in order of preference and then maybe stretching out bars, 
	sort of like how Humble Bundle lets you split your payments.</li>
	<li>It's been requested to add a per-scale feature that would scale down the 
	stats on any item above a certain item level to that item level.&nbsp; For 
	example, in PvP, items are scaled down to level 496 (as of writing).&nbsp; 
	Having this feature would allow someone to compare a level 522 PvE item 
	scaled down to 496 against a level 476 PvP item for arena use.<ul>
		<li>Curse user Erdluf suggests that the formula is something like this:<br />
		x = 1.13^(1/13).<br />
		so for going from say 522 to 496 stats (say mastery) would shrink by<br />
		pvpMastery = mastery / (x^(522-496))</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>It would be cool if Pawn could also keep track of upgrades for your 
	alts, for BoE items only.&nbsp; I want for there to be a way for you to be 
	able to clearly designate "this is my priest's discipline gear set" in the 
	addon, or something similar. Once Pawn has a better concept of "this is 
	which gear set this character wears for this task," I should be able to do 
	this.</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Known issues and bugs</h2>
<p>Check here first if you think you&#39;ve found a new bug; maybe I already know 
about it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn's quest advisor icons show up behind items when using some skinning 
	addons.&nbsp; (Apparently sometimes skins cause the icon to be at the 
	OVERLAY level.)</li>
	<li>Unverified: Pawn_Scrap causes Pawn to produce errors upon logging in.</li>
	<li>Unverified: Pawn adds the (?) icon to the line that EPGP adds to 
	tooltips as if it were a stat.</li>
	<li>Unverified: wands may only be getting the regular damage stats, and not 
	the ranged damage stats.</li>
	<li>Unverified: Fiery and other weapon damage enchantments are 
	only counting for the basic DPS stat, and not for the specialized DPS stats 
	like melee DPS.</li>
	<li>Weapon damage is actually stored in the game with more precision than is 
	displayed.&nbsp; For example, Gavel of Naaru Blessings says in-game that it 
	does 16-117 damage, but according to the game files, it does 16.12-116.12 
	damage.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to report its DPS as being slightly different 
	than the in-game tooltip says.</li>
	<li>Item links that you click that aren&#39;t already in your game cache show 
	the message &quot;Retrieving item information&quot; and then when the item appears, 
	there are no Pawn values until the next time you show that item.&nbsp; (I&#39;ve 
	found a potential solution to this issue that I&#39;ll try out sometime: waiting for 
	GameTooltip:OnSetItem to occur, if you&#39;re curious.)</li>
	<li>I&#39;ve noticed that sometimes the Loot Upgrade Advisor doesn&#39;t appear when 
	it should.&nbsp; (Pawn isn&#39;t getting the notification that a loot window has 
	appeared, so it doesn&#39;t know to show it.)</li>
</ul>

	for assassination rogues when using the default Wowhead scales.</li>
	<li>Fixed a rare bug that could occur with quests such as Returned Sevenfold

	guaranteed rewards on the icons for the reward choices.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appears to be new for patch 5.3 where inspecting 
	another player that you're not also targeting would not calculate an average 
	item level for that player's equipment.</li>

	longer show (?) on their tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.2</h3>

	(Their ranged weapons were only getting counted for half the appropriate 
	level.)</li>
	<li>The Reforging Advisor will now also show up when you right-click an item 
	while talking to an arcane reforger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn now includes French support, thanks to translation 
	volunteers othor and Snuff, and an untested Traditional Chinese translation 
	based on work by BNSSNB.</li>
	<li>Reduced Pawn's memory usage by about 35% (at least on my PC) by 
	optimizing the way translations are loaded.&nbsp; Pawn's memory usage should 
	return to about where it was back when it was for a single language only.</li>
	<li>Corrected a calculation problem where the Ghost Iron Dragonling trinket 
	was undervalued because Pawn suggested Cataclysm cogwheels for it instead of 
	Mists of Pandaria cogwheels.&nbsp; (Thanks durandal42!)</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor problem that could occur when using the Compare tab if you 
	used Pawn in the past (or on another computer), then stopped using it, then 
	sold some of your best items, and then started using it again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn now works for German and Russian in addition to 
	English.&nbsp; Big thanks to the translation volunteers Sandmahn and 
	mgotovtsev!&nbsp; It also has an untested Simplified Chinese translation 
	based on work by bigbamboo.</li>
	<li>This version also contains a large number of changes to prepare for 
	German, Russian, and more languages in the future.</li>
	<li>Some now-unnecessary information that was being stored in Pawn's 
	SavedVariables file will now be removed when logging out.</li>
	<li>Reorganized the Options tab to make it a bit cleaner.&nbsp; Options for 
	changing the digits of displayed precision for values and for controlling 
	the visibility of (?) icons on tooltips were removed.</li>
	<li>Changed a bunch of bits of text throughout Pawn.</li>
	<li>Worked around a problem that occurred with Pawn annotations showing up 
	on AtlasLoot items twice.&nbsp; (To show Pawn annotations on AtlasLoot 
	items, click Options in AtlasLoot and then check Use GameTooltip.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the Pyrium Weapon Chain and Living Steel Weapon Chain.</li>
	<li>Crystals of Fear will now no longer improperly show (?) on their 
	tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now properly show values and/or upgrades for mistweaver monks 
	as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed another typo that caused Pawn to show an error when high-level 
	engineers opened the Gems tab and prevented cogwheels from showing up in the 
	list.</li>
	<li>Changed the text "best in slot" to "your best" to make it more clear 
	that those items are not the best items you <i>could</i> get (the more 
	traditional definition of that term), but the best that you currently <i>
	have</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that occurred when clicking the "Normalize values (like 
	Wowhead)" checkbox on the Values tab as of Pawn 1.7.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a typo that caused Pawn to show an error when opening the 
	socketing window for an item with a cogwheel socket.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The way that Pawn uses gems and socketed items has changed drastically.&nbsp; 
	Pawn will now take an item's level into account and automatically select 
	gems of an appropriate quality to socket into that item for both the socketing 
	advisor, and also to use in calculating the internal item values for the 
	item.&nbsp; So, an epic from Heart of Fear will have Mists of Pandaria gems 
	suggested for it, and an epic from Naxxramas will have Wrath of the Lich 
	King gems suggested for it, without you having to do anything extra.&nbsp; You can still browse through items of various levels on the Gems 
	tab, but doing so no longer changes any settings and doesn't affect 
	calculations.<ul>
		<li>It is no longer possible to manually set a value for colored 
		sockets, cogwheel sockets, or the stats portion of meta sockets.&nbsp; 
		You can still assign a value to the special effects of meta gems ("3% 
		more damage on crits").</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Gems tab works a little differently now than it did in previous 
	versions.&nbsp; You can now have it show the best gems overall for a given scale, or you can 
	have it show the recommended gems for an item of a particular level.<ul>
		<li>When clicking the Pawn button that appears on the item socketing 
		window, the Gems tab will now automatically be set up to show you 
		recommended gems for an item of the level you're currently socketing.</li>
	<li>Since Pawn doesn't understand the special effects of meta gems but those 
	are the most important parts of meta gems, Pawn will no longer attempt to 
	suggest meta gems for you.&nbsp; You should instead use online class guides 
	to select the most appropriate meta gem.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sockets appear a little differently on the Compare tab than they did in 
	previous versions.&nbsp; The Compare tab will now show you the total 
	value of all sockets and socket bonuses on an item, including colored 
	sockets (either the correct colors of gems plus the socket bonus or all of 
	your best gem, depending on which strategy maximizes the item's value), meta 
	sockets (including the meta effect bonus), cogwheels, and sha-touched 
	weapons.&nbsp; It will also tell you whether you should go for the socket 
	bonus for a particular item without having to open the socketing advisor (so 
	you can find out on items you don't own).</li>
	<li>Made various other small improvements to the Compare tab to handle items 
	with large numbers of stats and scales with large values, so you don't see 
	things like "(+1234..." when numbers get too big to fit on the screen.&nbsp; 
	Now you'll see "(+12.3k)" instead.</li>
	<li>Added some features to make Pawn work with 
	some item tooltip changes in patch 5.1.</li>
	<li>Added new monk scales from Wowhead and removed the placeholder scales 
	for monks that were provided in earlier versions.</li>
	<li>When using the default settings, Pawn will now show you which of your 
	two rings is better so it's easy to tell which one you should replace with 
	your new one, instead of just saying "This is one of your best items."&nbsp; (This information was already available if you turned on 
	the "Show scale values and upgrade %" option.)</li>
	<li>The "add a blank line before values" option is now on by default because 
	it fits the new item tooltip style in patch 5.1 better.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it back off if you don't like it.&nbsp; I made a few other minor 
	modifications to tooltip formatting.</li>
	<li>Pawn will now show a very clear error message if you try to use the 
	English version of Pawn on a non-English World of Warcraft client.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced as of WoW 5.0 that prevented item levels from 
	showing up on the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>Made a few changes to the way that Pawn starts up that might help some 
	people who were having random troubles with Pawn not working properly 
	immediately upon logging in.</li>
	<li>Pawn 1.7 introduces a ton of changes to the calculation engine.&nbsp; 
	I ran a variety of tests, but please let me know if you notice any 
	anomalies.&nbsp; (If you report an issue, let me know which item and scale 
	you're seeing it on, and what appears to be wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead scales for all classes and specs except monks.&nbsp; 
	There are significant changes included for: Protection warrior, Protection 
	paladin, Beast mastery hunter, Assassination rogue, Combat rogue, Discipline 
	priest, Holy priest, Frost death knight, Unholy death knight, Elemental 
	shaman, Guardian druid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>By default, if you have a two-handed weapon equipped, Pawn will now not 
	show one-handed weapons or off-hand frill items as upgrades, and vice-versa.&nbsp; 
	(This is determined solely based on your character's currently equipped 
	weapon.)&nbsp; Enable the "Show upgrades for both 1H and 2H" option on the 
	Options tab to get back the old behavior, where Pawn will try to keep track 
	of your best two-handed weapon, main hand weapon, and off-hand weapon or 
	frill item separately, and show you upgrades for all of them, even if you 
	didn't typically use that type of item.</li>
	<li>Changed the way that Pawn thinks about upgrades compared to heirloom 
	items.&nbsp; Previously if you had an heirloom that scaled from level 1 to 
	80 that granted an XP bonus, it would never suggest another item as an 
	upgrade to that one until you hit level 81.&nbsp; Now it will immediately 
	start showing upgrades to that item upon hitting level 80, because those 
	items stop granting bonus XP as soon as you hit level 80.</li>
	<li>Made a change for a Spanish translation (in development) due to the fact 
	that the Spanish version of World of Warcraft doesn't use commas in numbers 
	like the English version (12,345) or periods like the German version 
	(12.345)—it displays with neither (12345).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added some placeholder scales for monks so that you can use Pawn as you 
	level your pandas!&nbsp; Once more reliable numbers are available I'll 
	include those, but these should be more than sufficient while leveling.<ul>
		<li>Since they're not from Wowhead, they'll show up in a separate 
		"Placeholder scales" category.&nbsp; This new category will sort at the 
		bottom of the list.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Wowhead scales will now never show ranged weapons as upgrades for 
	warriors and rogues, nor melee weapons as upgrades for hunters.</li>
	<li>Fixed another issue that Pawn had with understanding certain Mists of 
	Pandaria items with lots of stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a version mismatch issue I introduced with the latest update that 
	caused the Compare tab to not work properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where when the Loot Upgrade Advisor is disabled, the group 
	loot / need before greed roll window wouldn't appear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty calculation bug that occurred on items with more than 999 
	of a stat (the stat would only get 1/1000th of the correct number of 
	points).</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes using LinkWrangler and Pawn at the same 
	time would cause an error to appear when logging in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reimplemented the Loot Upgrade Advisor for the new group loot roll 
	windows in WoW 5.0.&nbsp; It should be functionally equivalent to the old 
	Loot Upgrade Advisor (green arrows on upgrades, and a yellow popup telling 
	you which scales and items it's an upgrade for).</li>
	<li>Added upgrade arrows to items in the Loot Rolls ("/loot") window and the 
	You Won! window.</li>
	<li>Temporarily altered the Wowhead hunter scales to include Expertise (at 
	the same values as Hit) until Wowhead updates their stat weights for 5.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Socketing Advisor tooltip obscured most of the 
	Socket Gems button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where weapon damage on heirloom weapons would not get 
	properly recognized and counted (and would spam your chat log with an 
	error).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where an error could occur when hovering over certain gemmed 
	relic items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a harmless error that could appear when trying to put a relic or 
	throwing weapon into the slots in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (You just can't let 
	that vendor trash go, can you?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for Pawn values on items in Void Storage.</li>
	<li>The spell penetration stat has been converted into the PvP power stat.&nbsp; 
	Any scales that had spell penetration now have PvP power in its place.</li>
	<li>The IsRelic and IsThrown stats are now gone, with no replacement (since relic 
	items and thrown weapons are now vendor trash).</li>
	<li>The stats list on the Values tab has been reorganized slightly.</li>
	<li>The Pawn window is now jade-colored and includes high-resolution art for 
	those of us with 30" monitors.</li>
	<li>Elite- and Heroic Elite-quality items will no longer show an unnecessary 
	(?) icon in Mists of Pandaria.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Initial compatibility with Mists of Pandaria and World of Warcraft 5.0.&nbsp; 
	Not all features will work properly on WoW 5.0 at this time.<ul>
		<li>No built-in scales are available for monks at this time.&nbsp; If 
		you'd like to test out Pawn on a monk but don't have custom stat values 
		you want to use, you have two options:<ul>
			<li>Make a copy of the stat values for the most similar druid spec: 
			go to the Scales tab, click the appropriate druid spec, click Copy, 
			and give the new scale a name.</li>
			<li>Start from a set of default stat values: go to the Scales tab, 
			click Defaults, and give the new scale a name.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fixed the issue where Pawn couldn't understand stats on tooltips 
		that were greater than 999 and now display with a comma.</li>
		<li>Added support for the new, generally shorter names of stats 
		("critical strike" instead of "critical strike rating", "pvp resilience" 
		instead of "resilience").</li>
		<li>Fixed an issue where monks would get errors when hovering over 
		armor.</li>
		<li>The Loot Upgrade Advisor is not functional in WoW 5.0.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that was causing Pawn to no longer function 
	properly after preordering Mists of Pandaria.</li>
	<li>Added the new level 90 Mists of Pandaria gems to the Gems tab if you're 
	using Pawn on Mists of Pandaria or the 5.0 PTRs.</li>
	<li>Removed the elemental resistance stats since they're not present on 
	modern gear.</li>
	<li>Removed the distinction between bonus armor and base armor since the 
	last items to feature bonus armor were in Wrath of the Lich King and Mists 
	of Pandaria isn't adding any.</li>
	<li>Added a potential bug fix for some sporadic problems where if some 
	players' addons load in a certain order, Pawn might not get initialized 
	properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.20</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a rare bug that could occur when showing the Loot Upgrade Advisor 
	when an upgrade drops and your computer didn't have the stats for the 
	previous best item for one of your scales from the server yet.</li>
	<li>Fixed (I believe) a long-standing bug where the same ring could be 
	chosen as both your first and second best item for that slot.&nbsp; (Thanks 
	to WildCard_25 for the investigation!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.19</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Non-caster classes will no longer have off-hand frill items suggested as 
	upgrades to their off-hand weapon by default (in the Wowhead scales), even if the secondary stats are 
	better, because this almost certainly just means that they aren't 
	dual-wielding, not that the item is <i>actually</i> useful.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor issue where conflicts with other addons could sometimes 
	cause an error when trying to calculate the average equipped item level of a 
	player you're inspecting.&nbsp; (Pawn still can't calculate the item level 
	in these cases, but it won't cause an error or display inaccurate 
	information.)</li>
	<li>Updated the default Wowhead stat values for warriors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.18</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the average item level calculation for Fury warriors who 
	use two two-handed weapons.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn annotations to the tooltips that appear in the "You are not 
	eligible for these items" window that appears when you kill bosses a second 
	time in Raid Finder runs, so you'll know how sad you should be that that axe 
	finally dropped when you can't roll on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now once again see someone's average equipped item level by 
	hovering over the Pawn button on the inspect window.&nbsp; (Your own 
	equipped item level is now in the General section of your stats list, even 
	without Pawn installed.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a long-standing issue where hovering over the Pawn button on the 
	inspect window could display inaccurate (too low) totals and average item 
	levels if the server hadn't sent your computer the stats for one or more of 
	the items the inspected player was wearing yet.&nbsp; (Now you know that 
	when you hover over someone at level 85 and see that their average item 
	level is 145, you know that they really<i> are</i> that much of a n00b and 
	it's not just a miscalculation.) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items found in the Raid Finder versions of the Dragon Soul raid will no 
	longer appear with an unnecessary (?) icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When you delete a character and then create a new character with the 
	same name but a different class, Pawn will now automatically hide the 
	Wowhead scales from the old class and show the Wowhead scales for the new 
	class.</li>
	<li>Corrected the display of the item you're upgrading in the loot upgrade 
	advisor.&nbsp; (Since 4.2 it would say things like "25% upgrade vs. 
	ff00ff00Your Old Item".)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added in the new epic gems available in WoW patch 4.3.&nbsp; (You can't 
	see them when you're on a 4.2 realm.)</li>
	<li>Corrected a few calculation errors for Guardian's Demonseye, Jagged 
	Dream Emerald, and Lightning Jasper.</li>
	<li>Hid the equipped average item level information from the Pawn tooltip 
	when on WoW 4.3 
	since that's now available on the character sheet without needing Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of the stats portion of meta sockets ("Meta: 
	stats") was being drastically overvalued (the "Meta: effect" value was being 
	included as well).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where it wasn't possible to manually override a value for 
	prismatic sockets.</li>
	<li>Possibly worked around an error that some people were receiving 
	("attempt to index field 'UnenchantedStats' (a nil value)") that may have 
	been related to Enchantrix or tekKompare.&nbsp; (I'm not sure because I was 
	never able to reproduce it myself.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added updated Wowhead scales for all classes and specs, significantly 
	updated for patch 4.2.&nbsp; (For example, the new scales for plate tanks no 
	longer include agility.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Pawn tooltip support to the encounter journal loot lists in patch 
	4.2.&nbsp; (This doesn't add upgrade arrows next to the items yet; the 
	upgrade arrows will be on the tooltips themselves.)</li>
	<li>Removed the unnecessary (?) that appeared on honor and conquest gear 
	next to "Season 9".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where one-handed caster weapons (not main hand weapons; 
	pretty much just Amani Scepter of Rites) would show up as massive upgrades 
	for your off-hand slot even though you couldn't actually put the item there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Items that bind to your Battle.net account will no longer get (?) icons 
	on them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Fierce Ember Topaz would be improperly suggested or 
	not suggested for socketing.&nbsp; (Calculations were still correct.)</li>
	<li>Added support for the three new Shadowspirit Diamond cuts that were 
	added in patch 4.0.6.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Gems tab would not show any gems if you were level 
	81+ didn't have two primary professions (wtf).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Upgrades that are less than half of a percent better than your current 
	gear will no longer be shown as upgrades.</li>
	<li>Fixed an annoying bug in 1.5.6 that was causing some people to get a lot 
	of errors (&quot;attempt to compare number with nil&quot;) and was causing upgrade 
	tracking features to not work properly for rings.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would occur when hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet
	if your computer hadn't downloaded information about your equipped items yet.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with a couple Nightstones being improperly suggested for 
	socketing.&nbsp; (Calculations involving those gems were still correct.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I added back a &quot;Show both current and base values&quot; option since some 
	people just couldn&#39;t live without it.&nbsp; <i>(...you whiners. :)</i></li>
	<li>Pawn&#39;s now smarter about what it considers as upgrades for heirloom 
	items.&nbsp; Heirloom weapons currently scale from level 1 to 80, so when 
	you&#39;re level 1 to 79, Pawn won&#39;t consider other weapons to be upgrades, but 
	when you hit level 80 it will start suggesting upgrades again.&nbsp; 
	Heirloom chests currently scale from level 1 to 80 so Pawn will work 
	similarly, but they give an XP boost until you hit level 81, so Pawn won&#39;t 
	start suggesting upgrades for your chest until you hit level 81.&nbsp; Once 
	you hit the level cap (85 if you have Cataclysm) then it will ignore 
	heirloom-ness for purposes of tracking upgrades.</li>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead stat weights for all warrior specs, holy and protection paladin, marksman hunter, holy priest, elemental shaman, all mage specs, and balance and resto druid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new per-scale option (on by default) that causes Pawn to never 
	consider armor that your class doesn&#39;t specialize in as an upgrade after your 
	character hits level 50.&nbsp; (For example, with the option on, a holy 
	paladin wearing crappy quest green plate that sees the most awesome epic mail healing 
	pants <em>evar</em> will still not see that item as an upgrade since it 
	would break the +5% intellect bonus for wearing only plate.)&nbsp; To change 
	this option, go to the Values tab, choose a scale, scroll down to the list 
	or armor types and click one, and then check the option that appears.</li>
	<li>Added new options to disable each of the Pawn advisors (loot upgrade 
	advisor, quest upgrade advisor, socketing advisor, and reforging advisor) 
	individually.</li>
	<li>Added a new option to no longer color the borders of tooltips for items 
	that are upgrades.&nbsp; (This is useful if you also use TipTac or just 
	really don&#39;t like that feature.)</li>
	<li>Added proper support for items with prismatic sockets (which will no 
	longer appear in the UI as red sockets) and cogwheel sockets (which were 
	previously ignored).</li>
	<li>The best cogwheels for each of your scales will now be listed on the 
	Gems tab when you&#39;re on an engineer of level 81 or higher.</li>
	<li>Included a bunch of new patch-4.0-friendly scales from Wowhead.</li>
	<li>The &quot;show current item values&quot; and &quot;show base item values&quot; options are 
	now gone.&nbsp; Base values are always shown, and current values are never 
	shown.<ul>
		<li>Update: I added this feature back in version 1.5.6.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Pawn UI now closes when you press the Escape key.</li>
	<li>Hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet will now list both 
	the average item level of your gear as well as the &quot;epic item level&quot; that it 
	did in the past.&nbsp; Pawn&#39;s epic item level number factors item rarity 
	into the value; the average item level ignores the rarity of the item and 
	will yield numbers that are more comparable to the ones you see in-game, 
	such as the Looking for Dungeon interface.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the socket values for Wowhead scales that aren&#39;t 
	visible on your character&#39;s tooltips (such as the ones for other classes) 
	were getting socket values calculated that were far too low.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where exported scales didn&#39;t include the quality of meta 
	gems to use.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where item recipes taught by a profession trainer would have 
	unnecessary (?) annotations.</li>
	<li>Fixed a minor display issue that occurred in the Loot Upgrade Advisor when a massive upgrade dropped 
	in a dungeon run.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Quest Upgrade Advisor will now put a question mark (?) icon on 
	trinkets.</li>
	<li>You can now show and hide scales by shift-clicking on their name in the 
	scale list.&nbsp; (Maybe this will help all those people who can&#39;t seem to 
	find the &quot;show scale in tooltips&quot; checkbox...)</li>
	<li>Added support for the dodge rating on the new Cataclysm head enchantment for tanks.</li>
	<li>When you copy a built-in (Wowhead) scale, the built-in scale will now be 
	automatically hidden.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you right-click an NPC who has a quest with some 
	items you&#39;ve never seen before and some that you have, Pawn would sometimes 
	display incorrect upgrade/vendor information.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, this 
	happens a lot when leveling.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where some reforged items were getting a few extra points in 
	their values for their reforging potential, which shouldn&#39;t happen since you 
	can&#39;t reforge an item a second time without restoring the original item 
	first.</li>
	<li>Updated stat weights from Wowhead for some rogue, death knight, and 
	shaman specs have been included.</li>
	<li>Added more detail to the &quot;Show item IDs&quot; option, which isn&#39;t too useful 
	to most people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty bug where sometimes hotkeyed spells and abilities would 
	stop working after using the reforging or item socketing UI.</li>
	<li>The Wowhead scales for rogues will now ignore upgrades for two-handed 
	weapons (which would just be fishing poles).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now set Pawn to hide upgrades for your one-handed weapon set and 
	your two-handed weapon on a per-scale basis.&nbsp; To change this setting, 
	go to the Values tab, select the scale you want to modify, and then find 
	either a one-handed or two-handed weapon in the list of weapon types, and 
	the new option will appear.&nbsp; (The option will not be visible for weapon 
	types that you cannot equip, such as daggers for paladins.)<ul>
		<li>For example, even though paladin tanks can use two-handed weapons, a 
		two-handed weapon is never an &quot;upgrade&quot; for a paladin tanking set, so 
		you can turn off upgrade notifications for them.&nbsp; Similarly, 
		retribution paladins can use one-handed weapons, but they are never 
		upgrades.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The amount by which you can increase an item&#39;s score through reforging 
	is now shown on the Compare tab as &quot;Reforge potential,&quot; and is now 
	automatically added to the score of an item.<ul>
		<li>This is consistent with how Pawn treats empty sockets—the assumption 
		is that if you care about the item you will gem and reforge it properly.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added a new stat, &quot;Off-hand frill,&quot; which applies to all &quot;held in off 
	hand&quot; caster items, and not off-hand weapons.</li>
	<li>The Compare tab will now also show the percentage increase in the score 
	of the better item in addition to the score difference.</li>
	<li>Cloaks will no longer be counted as cloth items, so scales that have 
	&quot;items with this are unusable&quot; set for cloth armor will now get values for 
	cloaks.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the item link window could have a green border when it 
	shouldn&#39;t.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error that could sometimes occur when adding off-hand items to 
	the Compare tab using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Low-level items with elemental spell damage (&quot;of Fiery Wrath&quot; and so on) 
	will now be treated as if they had spell power, rather than having a 
	specific unique stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added the Reforging Advisor, which suggests the way to modify an item 
	that will maximize its value when you&#39;re visiting an Arcane Reforger.<ul>
		<li>Be careful when reforging hit rating and expertise; if you adjust 
		your scales to reduce the value of those stats when you&#39;re at or near 
		the cap, Pawn will determine that the item&#39;s value would be maximized if 
		you reforged the hit or expertise into something else, which may take 
		you below the cap.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cataclysm gem cuts are now available on the Gems tab, including many 
	that weren&#39;t available in beta.&nbsp; To update your scales to use the new 
	gems, just select them from the lists on the Gems tab.&nbsp; (This is a 
	per-scale setting.)</li>
	<li>The upgrade annotations on weapons will now show which weapon set (1H or 
	2H) the item is upgrading so it&#39;s more clear that, for example, some random 
	green dagger isn&#39;t better than Shadowmourne; it&#39;s just better than your 
	skinning knife.</li>
	<li>Prismatic sockets on relic items will now get a proper value.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn will treat them as red sockets, but since there are no socket bonuses, 
	it won&#39;t really matter—Pawn will assume that you will socket the best gem of any color when 
	calculating the value.)</li>
	<li>If any of the reward choices for a quest is a trinket, Pawn will now 
	never show the coins (highest vendor price) icon on any item for that quest 
	so you aren&#39;t as likely to accidentally take a useless item if there&#39;s a 
	nice trinket available.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now tells you when an item you&#39;re looking at is an upgrade to your 
	current best gear for a particular scale.<ul>
		<li>Pawn scans your equipped items and all of your Equipment Manager 
		sets to find your best items for each of your scales.</li>
		<li>Tooltips of items that are better than the best item of the same 
		type will get an upgrade icon and have an upgrade percentage listed.<ul>
			<li>Trinkets are ignored since they have special effects that Pawn 
			can&#39;t value that drastically affect their usefulness.</li>
			<li>For rings, items that are better than your <em>second</em>-best 
			ring will be shown as an upgrade.</li>
			<li>Items can be an upgrade for multiple scales simultaneously.&nbsp; 
			For example, if you had a &quot;healing throughput&quot; scale and a &quot;healing 
			regen&quot; scale, a nice new healing weapon might be better than your 
			current weapon for both of those scales.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You can easily compare items against your current best-in-slot items 
		using new buttons added to the Compare tab.</li>
		<li>Pawn currently assumes that you&#39;ll want to keep a two-hander around 
		as well as two one-handers, so upgrades for either set are 
		handled independently.&nbsp; This can create some odd situations; for 
		example, a shaman with no interest in two-handed weapons at all will see 
		most two-handed weapons as a potential upgrade.<ul>
			<li>If you want to avoid this, you can set the two-handed weapon 
			stats (&quot;Axe: 2H,&quot; &quot;Polearm,&quot; etc.) to Ignored on the Values tab for 
			your scale(s).&nbsp; You can&#39;t make changes to the built-in Wowhead 
			scales directly, so you&#39;d have to make a copy of the scale first, 
			hide the Wowhead one, and then modify your copy.&nbsp; I&#39;ll look 
			into ways of making this less stupid in future versions.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The new upgrade features can be turned off entirely from the Options 
		tab if you find them annoying.</li>
		<li>Added the Quest Upgrade Advisor, which adds an arrow icon next to quest 
	rewards that are upgrades for you, or if none of the rewards are good, adds 
	a coins icon next to the reward that will vendor for the most money.</li>
		<li>Added the Loot Upgrade Advisor, which adds a popup window next to 
		the roll window when an item drops that is an upgrade for you.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The default behavior has changed so that Pawn only modifies tooltips of 
	items that are upgrades.&nbsp; Existing Pawn users will probably want to 
	change the &quot;Show upgrades on tooltips&quot; option to &quot;Show scale values and upgrade %.&quot;</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in patch 4.0.3 where haste and resilience 
	rating on items was not being recognized.</li>
	<li>Quest rewards shown on the world map will now have Pawn values shown on 
	them.</li>
	<li>&quot;Currently equipped&quot; tooltips attached to the item link window will now 
	have Pawn values shown on them.</li>
	<li>Added a new &quot;stat&quot; for all off-hand weapons.&nbsp; The Wowhead scales 
	for specs that can&#39;t use off-hand weapons have that stat ignored. </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in Pawn&#39;s item score cache that was causing unnecessary 
	slowdowns when Pawn needed to calculate several values at once, such as when 
	hovering over the Pawn button on your character sheet, or when &quot;currently 
	equipped&quot; tooltips are visible.</li>
	<li>Scales can no longer mark the weapon speed &quot;stat&quot; as ignored.</li>
	<li>Updated the Wowhead scales to add a placeholder value for mastery 
	rating.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of spirit in the Wowhead shadow priest scale to the 
	levels of hit rating due to the Twisted Faith talent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will no longer put a (?) next to &quot;Reforged&quot; on reforged items.</li>
	<li>Spell penetration is once again properly recognized on items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now suggest gems based on the colors and cuts available in 
	patch 4.0.</li>
	<li>The new Cataclysm gem cuts (as well as the old Burning Crusade 
	cuts) are available in Pawn&#39;s Gems tab.&nbsp; You can select them using the 
	dropdown lists at the top.&nbsp; (As before, you can choose a different 
	quality of gems for each of your scales.)&nbsp; The Cataclysm cuts are not 
	visible unless on the Cataclysm beta.</li>
	<li>The built-in Wowhead scales have been adjusted somewhat for patch 4.0.&nbsp; 
	Hopefully they should better reflect updated class mechanics in 4.0, but 
	they do not currently match the stat weights on Wowhead exactly.&nbsp; If you have suggestions, please see
	<a href="http://cata.wowhead.com/forums&topic=169544&p=2315094">this thread 
	on the Wowhead theorycrafting forums</a>.</li>
	<li>Many stats have been removed from items and are thus also removed from 
	Pawn.&nbsp; Your existing scales will be automatically converted to take 
	this into account:<ul>
		<li>The following stats will be removed from scales entirely since they 
		were removed from items: armor penetration, defense rating, block value, 
		block rating, ranged attack power, and all forms of single-school spell 
		damage.</li>
		<li>If the scale contains a value for MP5 and its value for Spirit is 
		less than half of the scale&#39;s value for MP5, Spirit will be raised to 
		that amount.&nbsp; MP5 is removed from scales.&nbsp; MP5 still appears 
		on socket bonuses for a few healer items; those socket bonuses will be 
		considered to have 2 Spirit per 1 MP5 for purposes of calculations.</li>
		<li>The druid concept of &quot;feral attack power&quot; no longer exists, so the 
		fake Feral AP stat has been removed from Pawn as well.&nbsp; Be sure to 
		add weapon DPS to scales to compensate.</li>
		<li>The following stats have been removed from scales because they are 
		very rare: Health per 5, raw mana, and raw health.&nbsp; Items or 
		enchantments with these rare stats will be instead considered to have 
		points in base stats (Stamina, Intellect) for purposes of calculations.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A bunch of new fixes to make Pawn work on the Cataclysm beta and the 4.0 
	PTRs.&nbsp; This version also works fine on live realms.<ul>
		<li>Mastery rating now works again.</li>
		<li>The problem where Pawn would hang after scanning approximately 50 
		items has been resolved.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an embarrassing typo that caused staves and polearms to not get 
	Pawn values for classes that cannot also use two-handed swords, axes, and 
	maces (everyone but warriors, I guess?).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stats with negative values will no longer be taken into account when normalizing 
	item values.&nbsp; (For example, if a scale is Stamina = 10, Intellect = 5, 
	Spirit = -10, then all values for that scale will be divided by 15, not 5.)</li>
	<li>You can now mark stats as &quot;unusable.&quot;&nbsp; Items that have that stat on 
	them will get no value for that scale.&nbsp; For example, a scale for 
	shamans can mark plate as unusable, and then all plate armor will get no 
	value for that scale since shamans can&#39;t wear it.</li>
	<li>The built-in scales now take advantage of the unusable stats feature, so 
	unequippable items will not receive values.&nbsp; (Your character&#39;s current 
	level is not taken into account for this, so for example low-level shamans 
	and hunters will still get values on mail items even though they can&#39;t wear 
	mail until level 40.)</li>
	<li>There are now separate stats for the one-handed and two-handed versions 
	of axes, maces, and swords.&nbsp; Existing scales that had a value for those 
	weapon types will now only have a value for the one-handed version of those 
	weapon types and will need to be updated manually.</li>
	<li>Hopefully fixed the bug that a few people were seeing where they sometimes could 
	not select scales.&nbsp; I finally ran into it myself and tried an 
	on-the-spot fix that worked for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Improved the appearance of the Pawn UI.&nbsp; It&#39;s now no longer 
	translucent, so it should be easier to read the text in certain 
	circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented additional performance enhancements so that Pawn uses even 
	less memory and CPU time.&nbsp; Having the Wowhead scales loaded now 
	increases Pawn&#39;s memory and CPU usage by only a negligible amount, so I 
	don&#39;t recommend disabling them anymore.</li>
	<li>Added an arrow icon to the best item shown on the Compare tab to make it 
	clearer at a glance and for colorblind people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn wouldn&#39;t recalculate which gems were best for a 
	scale after chanigng stat values until the next time you logged in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a separate bug where sometimes the display of socket values that 
	were calculated automatically (as opposed to manually set) would not display 
	correctly, even if they were properly calculated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Thanks to some gnomish performance engineering, Pawn now uses about 95% 
	less CPU time during login, which should reduce your login times by a second 
	or two.</li>
	<li>Added a new scale from Wowhead for arms warriors.</li>
	<li>Changed the (*) warning message to be a little clearer, and now it has a 
	new (?) icon.&nbsp; Pawn now calls item properties that it doesn&#39;t recognize 
	&quot;special effects.&quot;</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the item special effect warning message wasn&#39;t showing up 
	even when enabled.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that might occur after the Wowhead scales (or any 
	scales from a &quot;plugin&quot; of any sort) were disabled by deleting 
	Wowhead.lua.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Changed a bunch of text to make it even easier for new users to get 
	started with Pawn.</li>
	<li>The default for new users of Pawn is now to only show the base values of 
	items.&nbsp; If you&#39;re already using Pawn and have current item values 
	shown, your settings won&#39;t be changed and you&#39;ll still see both numbers.</li>
	<li>Rearranged the list of stats on the Values tab so that more common stats 
	are easier to find, and really rare stats like raw health aren&#39;t wasting 
	prime screen real estate.</li>
	<li>Added support for items with mastery rating for those of you in the 
	Cataclysm beta.&nbsp; (Untested.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue for patch 3.3.5 that prevented you from linking gems from 
	the Gems tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a very small value for Stamina for Wowhead scales that did not 
	already include Stamina.&nbsp; This will help prevent certain very odd gems 
	from appearing as suggestions in the Gems tab.&nbsp; (For example, some DPS 
	scales did not include values for any blue stat, so the ret pally Gems tab 
	included a gem with Spirit!)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn disabled the Blizzard UI&#39;s item comparison 
	tooltip that appears when you hold down the shift key while your mouse is 
	over an item link window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Export button would generate an invalid scale tag 
	for the Wowhead scales.&nbsp; Now you can properly export the Wowhead scales 
	just like your own.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the Pawn socketing suggestions window would not show 
	the proper name of Wowhead scales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.3</h3>
<p><strong>Important!&nbsp; </strong>After upgrading to Pawn 
	1.3, your Pawn settings and scales will be upgraded and will no longer be 
visible in older versions of Pawn.&nbsp; If you need to revert to an older version of Pawn, 
use the new /pawn backup command to make a backup copy of your scales that you 
can save in a file on your computer.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can now see and edit all of your scales in the Pawn UI, regardless 
	of which character you&#39;re currently on.&nbsp; (You&#39;ll need to log into 
	each of your characters once first.)&nbsp; Each of your scales can be 
	shown in tooltips for just one or none of your characters (like in previous 
	versions), or you can have a scale show up in the tooltips for multiple 
	different characters.</li>
	<li>All of the stat weight presets from Wowhead are now included with Pawn, 
	so you can immediately start using it without needing to import or create 
	any scales if you don&#39;t feel like customizing.&nbsp; The Wowhead scales 
	can&#39;t be changed, but if you want to use them as a starting point for your 
	own scales you can copy them and modify the copy.<ul>
		<li>If you have feedback for the Wowhead scales, please see the
		<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&amp;board=20" target="_blank">
		Wowhead Theorycrafting forum</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The new Scale tab now contains most of the per-scale options (such as 
	whether it shows up on your character&#39;s tooltips), as well as the options 
	for importing, exporting, and creating scales.&nbsp; The Values tab 
	(previously the Scales tab) is now a bit simpler.</li>
	<li>The list of scales now appears in a pane to the left of the Pawn UI instead of in 
	a dropdown.&nbsp; The scales that are visible on the current character&#39;s 
	tooltips will appear at the top of the list.</li>
	<li>The &quot;Normalize values (like Wowhead)&quot; option can now be set individually 
	for each of your scales for finer control.</li>
	<li>Added a new command <strong>/pawn backup</strong> that you can use to 
	back up all of your custom scales at once as a big mass of scale tags.</li>
	<li>Item levels will now only appear on items in the Compare tab if you also 
	have them enabled for item tooltips in Interface Options.</li>
	<li>If you hold down the Shift key when clicking the Delete button to delete 
	a scale, the scale will now be deleted immediately without requiring 
	confirmation.</li>
	<li>Many bugs were fixed, including several bugs that only existed in 
	pre-release versions of Pawn 1.3 and are not listed here:<ul>
		<li>Fixed a potential error when setting up default Pawn keybindings when using Pawn for the first time for a 
	character, and added a 
	diagnostic message to help determine why the problem is occurring.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where often the first item comparison you performed in the 
	Compare tab wouldn&#39;t show item values until you clicked the Swap button or 
	the list of scales.</li>
		<li>Fixed the error that would occur when trying to put an heirloom item in 
	the Compare tab.</li>
		<li>Fixed a display issue where scales with colons (&#39;:&#39;) in their names 
		would appear incorrectly on tooltips if the &quot;align values to right edge 
		of tooltip&quot; option were enabled.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where the scale total values listed when hovering over a 
	Pawn button on someone&#39;s character sheet weren&#39;t listed in alphabetical order.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What used to be called the enchanted value of an item is now the current 
	value, and what used to be called the unenchanted value is now the base 
	value.&nbsp; The word &quot;base&quot; now also appears on tooltips.&nbsp; (No functionality has changed; this is just a terminology 
	change.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the error that occurred when hovering over Brewfest steins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that occurred when hovering over profession recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now select what quality of gems to use for each of your scales 
	on the Gems tab: uncommon, rare, or epic.&nbsp; Each scale can have a 
	different quality level, so your main spec scale can use epic gems, and your 
	offspec scale can use rare gems.</li>
	<li>By popular request, enchanted values of items now no longer include any 
	points for sockets on the item, since the enchanted value is meant to 
	reflect the current state of the item.&nbsp; This means that before you put 
	gems in an item, the enchanted value of an item will be lower than the 
	unenchanted value.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where occasionally items that weren&#39;t enchanted would show 
	two equal values, such as &quot;123.4 (123.4)&quot;.&nbsp; (This was only a display 
	issue; the values were being calculated properly.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now calculate correct socket values if you have the &quot;normalize 
	values (like Wowhead)&quot; option enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;attempt to perform arithmetic on field &#39;?&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	error that some users were experiencing in Pawn 1.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Note:</b> Upon installation, this version of Pawn will automatically make adjustments to 
	each of your
scales&#39; socket values.&nbsp; To avoid this, you can turn off the option for each 
	scale to always correctly match gem colors.</li>
	<li>By default, Pawn will automatically choose the best rare-quality level 
	80 gem of each color and use the value of that gem when calculating item 
	values.&nbsp; Most people will no longer ever need to manually set values 
	for red, yellow, or blue sockets.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a new Gems tab in the Pawn UI.&nbsp; This tab shows you the 
	best rare-quality level 80 gems that are available for any of your scales.&nbsp; 
	Never again will you wonder which gems to have cut for that new boss drop.
	<ul>
		<li>The Gems tab also displays suggested meta gems, but take these with a grain of
		salt; Pawn ignores the special effects on the gem.</li>
		<li>The Gems tab only considers rare-quality level 80 gems.&nbsp; I&#39;ll 
		add support for epic gems very soon in an upcoming Pawn update.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn will now add a tooltip to the item socketing window displaying the 
	suggested gems to use when socketing that item for each of your scales.&nbsp; 
	In addition, the window now has a Pawn button that takes you directly to the 
	Gems tab for more details.</li>
	<li>Meta sockets are now covered by two values instead of one: the old "Meta socket" value
	is now "Meta: stats" and covers the normal stat bonuses from meta gems.  The
	new value is "Meta: effect" and covers the bonus effects from meta gems.  Helms with an
	empty meta socket will get the values from both added to their totals.  Helms with a
	filled meta socket will get the values of Meta: effect and the actual stats on the gem added
	to their totals.  This reflects the fact that stat-for-stat, helms with meta sockets are clearly
	better than helms without them because of the added effects that meta gems bring.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of MP5 in the default scale to correspond with current itemization.</li>
	<li>Removed the Pawn feature to show item levels, as it is now built into the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;Could not parse the item link&quot; error that appeared when 
	clicking the links that items such as the Titanium Seal of Dalaran and Worn 
	Troll Dice add to chat.</li>
	<li>Corrected the display of socket bonuses on weapons in the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>(English) Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality now works again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the "attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'Dps&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	issue introduced by 1.1.12 relating to feral attack power calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Though it doesn&#39;t actually exist as a real weapon stat anymore, druids 
	can once again assign a value to feral attack power instead of weapon DPS if 
	they don&#39;t like multiplying by 14.</li>
	<li>Updated Outfitter support to handle newer versions of Outfitter.&nbsp; 
	(If alternate outfit tooltips stop working for you, be sure to download the 
	latest version of Outfitter too.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;show item levels&quot; is enabled, you can now hover over the Pawn 
	button on your character sheet or an inspected player&#39;s character sheet to 
	get an estimate of that player&#39;s average item level in epic gear.&nbsp; For 
	example, an epic gear level of 200 means that the player is in full 10-man 
	Naxxramas gear; 213 means that the player is in full 25-man Naxxramas gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for Pawn values on Outfitter alternate-outfit tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where scales that used to have a value for colorless sockets 
	back when Pawn included them as a possible stat would show inaccurate values 
	if you had normalization turned on.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where armor penetration gems (like Fractured Scarlet Ruby) 
	didn&#39;t work in the English version.</li>
	<li>Added support for Titanium Plating and Enchant Weapon: Accuracy.</li>
	<li>Minor updates for colorblind mode in patch 3.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed the feral attack power stat entirely since it no longer exists 
	directly on weapons.&nbsp; (Feral druids should increase their value for 
	weapon DPS accordingly.)</li>
	<li>Added compatibility with the mod tdItemTip.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One more potential fix for the error that I worked on in the last 
	version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Pawn would in rare situations cause an error when it was 
	loaded for the first time for a character (either a new character, or a 
	character new to Pawn).&nbsp; Whether or not a given person would actually 
	experience this bug is essentially random.&nbsp; This is also reported to 
	have worked around game crashes that a few people were seeing.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality, and the hit rating 
	effect of Titanium Weapon Chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Feral druids and death knights rejoice!&nbsp; You can now assign 
	separate values to base armor (on cloth, cloaks, leather, mail, and plate) and bonus 
	armor (on weapons, trinkets, necklaces, rings, and enchantments).<ul>
		<li>Please note that pre-Wrath items that had bonus armor (in green 
		text) will have the full armor value reported as base armor even though 
		some is bonus armor.&nbsp; There is currently no way for mods to tell 
		the difference.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated the default values for the socket stats to more appropriate 
	values, assuming that you would use level 80 blue gems in them.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be changed.</li>
	<li>Support for colorless / prismatic sockets added by blacksmithing has 
	been removed.&nbsp; Since these sockets never appear on items normally, and 
	they are simply an interim stage (you&#39;d never socket an item and then decide 
	not to put a gem in it), I decided it didn&#39;t make sense to assign values to 
	them. </li>
	<li>The red text that appears after socketed jewelcrafter-only BoP gems that 
	says that they require jewelcrafting will no longer appear with an asterisk 
	(*).</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Icewalker.</li>
	<li>Worked around a bug that could cause the Compare tab to stop working in 
	certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where, on the Compare tab, meta sockets would appear under 
	the &quot;socket bonus&quot; heading instead of the &quot;sockets&quot; heading.</li>
	<li>Enchantments that are on enchanters&#39; rings when you are not an enchanter 
	(the ones that appear in red) will no longer appear with asterisks (*).</li>
	<li>Armor penetration rating on new Wrath of the Lich King items will now be 
	interpreted correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This is the patch 3.0 version of Pawn, and will not work properly on WoW 
	2.4.x.&nbsp; The stats Spell damage, Healing, Spell hit rating, Spell crit 
	rating, and Spell haste rating have all been removed.&nbsp; Spell damage and 
	Healing have been replaced with Spell power, and the three Spell combat 
	ratings have been combined into hybrid ratings that work for both casters 
	and non-casters.&nbsp; Pawn will update your scales automatically, but you 
	might want to check the values of those stats to make sure that they are in 
	line with what you&#39;d expect.</li>
	<li>Added stats that allow you to assign different values to different armor 
	types (such as plate, cloth, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for account-bound (gold-quality) items and more new things that appear in 
	WoW 3.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error message that could appear when using some item links from 
	sites like Wowhead.</li>
	<li>Armor penetration works once more on WoW 3.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Link Wrangler compatibility, which was broken in Pawn 1.1.</li>
	<li>Items that have at least one recognized stat (normally marked with an 
	asterisk) will be marked as such in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (This feature 
	existed in 1.1 betas but did not appear in the final version.)</li>
	<li>Added support for Lake Wintergrasp items and the Scourgestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn has been tested on both the live realms and on the Wrath of 
the Lich King beta, and includes <i>tons</i> of fixes to make Pawn work 
	correctly on Wrath servers, and to support new stats and types of items that 
	appear in the expansion content, including new stats, new gems, encrypted 
	items, colorless sockets, and more.</li>
	<li>Pawn now sports a new tab, Compare, which lets you see two items 
	side-by-side to compare their stats in more detail.&nbsp; Check it out!<ul>
		<li>You can compare any two items in your inventory or a merchant&#39;s 
		inventory by dropping them in 
		the slots.</li>
		<li>If the left slot is empty and you drop an item in the right slot, 
		your currently equipped item will automatically be put in the left slot.</li>
		<li>In addition to dragging and dropping items, all of the following 
		shortcuts also work:<ul>
			<li>Clicking either of the &quot;currently equipped&quot; shortcut buttons 
			that appear in the lower-left corner once there is an item in the 
			right slot.</li>
			<li>Hovering over an item in your inventory, another player&#39;s 
			inventory, a vendor&#39;s inventory, an item link window, AtlasLoot, or 
			other locations, and pressing the &quot;[&quot; or 
			&quot;]&quot; key.&nbsp; (This key binding is customizable in the regular key 
			bindings interface.)</li>
			<li>You can also right-click item link windows and item icons in 
			loot roll windows to immediately compare the item with your 
			currently equipped item.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The first time you run Pawn after upgrading to 1.1, Pawn will 
	automatically bind keys to its commands if you aren&#39;t using those keys for 
	other things.&nbsp; By default, &quot;P&quot; will open and close the Pawn UI, and &quot;[&quot; 
	and &quot;]&quot; are used for item comparisons.&nbsp; If 
	you later unbind those keys or bind them to other actions, Pawn won&#39;t try to 
	rebind them.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn values didn&#39;t show up on item link windows if you 
	only had unenchanted numbers visible, not enchanted numbers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where error text would appear in the chat window when 
	hovering over recipes in Ackis Recipe List and possibly other similar mods.</li>
	<li>German users rejoice!&nbsp; When entering stat values you can now use a 
	comma instead of a period as a decimal separator—for example, &quot;0,5&quot; now 
	works in addition to &quot;0.5&quot;.</li>
	<li>In this version of Pawn, I&#39;ve significantly reorganized a lot of the code that reads 
	and annotates item tooltips.&nbsp; This, coupled with other changes in Wrath 
	of the Lich King, is likely to cause some conflicts with other mods.&nbsp; 
	If you run into problems with Pawn, please remember to try to reproduce the 
	same problem with no other item-related mods installed.&nbsp; I still may be 
	able to fix the bug if it turns out that the bug is related to another mod, 
	but I need to know <i>which</i> mod to download and try.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would prevent Pawn from working properly if one or
	more of your scales didn't assign a value to the spell damage stat.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of the armor penetration and spell penetration stats 
	in the default Pawn scale to match current itemization.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales are not changed.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer try to assign a default value to spell damage (WoW 2.4) if you use
	a scale that contains only spell power (WoW 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an entry in the Interface Options dialog to launch the Pawn UI, in 
	case you hide the Pawn button and forget how to get it back.</li>
	<li>You can now assign a value to the Wrath of the Lich King &quot;spell power&quot; 
	stat to your scales.&nbsp; It uses the same values by default as the &quot;spell 
	power&quot; stat in Pawn 0.7.4, and your existing scales will be assigned a value 
	for the stat automatically.&nbsp; Your scales will still have spell damage 
	and healing stats in them, but they won&#39;t be used for anything.</li>
	<li>In Wrath of the Lich King, the stats that currently appear as melee hit 
	rating, melee crit rating, and melee haste will also apply to spells, and 
	the spell hit, crit, and haste rating stats are not used.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be modified at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When Armory is installed, added support for showing unenchanted values 
	on the item comparison tooltips that appear when holding down the Alt key.</li>
	<li>Added support for the stat-only components of Surefooted, Cat&#39;s 
	Swiftness, and Boar&#39;s Speed.&nbsp; (The run speed and snare resistance 
	effects are ignored since there are no Pawn stats for those.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked a link for an item that had an icon and 
	then a link for a spell that did not have an icon, the item&#39;s icon would not 
	properly disappear.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with reading certain items with multiple stats on the same 
	line that was causing problems with the French translation in progress.</li>
	<li>Removed a bunch more asterisks from various items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s now possible to force Pawn to always calculate an item&#39;s value 
	based on the correct color of gems (Pawn 0.8 and older behavior) instead of 
	maximizing the item&#39;s value by potentially using the wrong colors and 
	ignoring the socket bonus (Pawn 0.9 and later behavior).&nbsp; To change the 
	option for one of your scales, choose that scale in the UI and then choose 
	one of the colored sockets from the stat list.</li>
	<li>Added support for socket bonuses (and possible future gems) that give 
	melee haste rating.</li>
	<li>Added shaman healing scales based on the popular Elitist Jerks thread to 
	the sample scales document that comes with Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored compatibility with Link Wrangler, which stopped working in Pawn 0.9.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing Pawn values on Link Wrangler&#39;s &quot;compare 
	equipped items&quot; tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing inventory icons next to Link Wrangler 
	tooltips.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a &quot;getting started&quot; tab to gently remind new users to read 
	the Readme file.</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of new WoW 2.4 functionality to show inventory icons 
	next to item link windows in a few situations where it couldn&#39;t before.</li>
	<li>Various other UI and text tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn is now smarter about the way that it values sockets and socket 
	bonuses, which in some cases will slightly change the values of certain 
	items, both with and without gems.<ul>
		<li>If you&#39;ve already filled all of the sockets on an item and you don&#39;t 
		qualify for the socket bonus, Pawn no longer counts the socket bonus 
		stats, since they&#39;re not actually there.</li>
		<li>If you can get a better value by socketing the wrong colors of gems 
		and ignoring the socket bonus, Pawn will now do that when calculating 
		item values.&nbsp; (When the &quot;Show debug info&quot; option is enabled, Pawn 
		will tell you which color gems it used.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn now remembers all of the stats from several of the last items 
	you&#39;ve viewed so it doesn&#39;t have to always recalculate them.&nbsp; This 
	should help your framerate when rapidly hovering over many items in 
	succession, especially when an equip compare mod is also installed.</li>
	<li>You now have to type the word &quot;delete&quot; to confirm that you really want 
	to delete a scale.</li>
	<li>You can now make a copy of an existing scale by clicking the new Copy 
	button.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to hide a specific scale from tooltips without 
	having to delete it (and, most likely, export it and paste it somewhere for 
	safekeeping).</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer look for stats on quest, spell, and ability links in 
	WoW 2.4.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bunch of UI bugs that occurred when deleting your last scale.</li>
	<li>Pawn no longer adds unnecessary asterisks to Black Temple instance-bound items, such as Naj&#39;entus Spine.</li>
	<li>Added support for Reckless Noble Topaz and other gems with spell haste 
	rating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now displays the current Pawn version number on the last 
	tab.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports addons that modify the Inspect window when it is first 
	shown instead of immediately upon login, such as Spyglass.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now hover over the Pawn button on the inventory window to get a 
	grand total of the enchanted values on all of your equipped items.</li>
	<li>There is now a disabled Pawn button on the inspect window that you can 
	hover over to get totals for all of another player&#39;s equipped items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where all on/off options that defaulted to being on (show 
	enchanted values, show unenchanted values, and show tooltip icons) would 
	automatically turn back on after logging out and back in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes disabling enchanted values would cause 
	unenchanted values to also not be displayed.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the word &quot;Projectile&quot; on stacks of arrows would get an 
	asterisk, and their DPS would not count as ranged DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where negative values would not be exported in scale tags.&nbsp; 
	(Negative stat values are most common with weapon speed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now has an Options tab that you can use to set all Pawn 
	options.</li>
	<li>Almost all of the Pawn slash commands are now unnecessary, and have been 
	removed.&nbsp; You can still use /pawn to open the Pawn UI, and /pawn debug 
	is still available as well.</li>
	<li>Tooltips have been added to pretty much everything in the Pawn UI.</li>
	<li>You can use the new calculation option &quot;Normalize values&quot; to divide all of your scale values by 
	the sum of all of the numbers in the scale.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to 
	generate the same sorts of numbers that Lootzor does.&nbsp; (See the 
	appropriate section in the readme file for more details.)</li>
	<li>You can now change the text color for your scales individually from the 
	Pawn UI.&nbsp; You could, for example, make your healing scale show up in 
	white and your DPS scale show up in red.</li>
	<li>You can now bind a key to the Pawn UI.&nbsp; Look under &quot;Pawn&quot; in the 
	standard key bindings list.</li>
	<li>Added support for the Fiery Weapon enchantment; Pawn counts it as 4 dps.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes tooltip icons would not appear for items 
	that had never been in your inventory.&nbsp; (This includes most links in 
	trade chat.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked on an item link for an item, and then a 
	tradeskill recipe (such as [Alchemy: Super Mana Potion]), the icon for the 
	previous item would stay since the recipe did not have one.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you had set custom colors for your scales, scales 
	would no longer always be sorted alphabetically by name on item tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now shows inventory icons next to item link and item comparison 
	tooltips, so when someone links an item, you can also see its inventory 
	icon.&nbsp; You can turn this feature off with /pawn icons off.<ul>
		<li>This feature works with the built-in WoW functionality, as well as a 
		variety of other tooltip mods: EquipCompare, EQCompare, and MultiTips.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When /pawn ids on is active, Pawn now displays the item IDs of all 
	applicable enchantments and gems in the tooltip as well.&nbsp; For example, 
	if looking at item 123 with no enchantment and gems 45 and 67 socketed, you 
	would see &quot;Item ID: 123:0:45:67&quot;.</li>
	<li>You can now have Pawn align item values (and IDs and levels, if those 
	options are on) along the right side of the tooltip with /pawn align numbers 
	right.&nbsp; Some people may find this easier to read; others may find it 
	more difficult.</li>
	<li>A new category of stats has been added, &quot;weapon types,&quot; which is 
	primarily useful for racial abilities and talents.<ul>
		<li>For example, orcs 
	get a passive 5 expertise bonus when using axes.&nbsp; So, you might give a 
		weapon a few bonus points just for being an axe.&nbsp; At level 70, 5 
		expertise costs 78.8 expertise rating, so you might value &quot;being an axe&quot; 
		as high as 78.8.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn plugins for FuBar and Titan Panel are now available as 
	separate downloads.&nbsp; You can get them at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/">Curse</a>.</li>
	<li>The old &quot;spell power&quot; stat made sense before patch 2.3, but it was 
	particularly confusing to healers after that patch, so I&#39;ve removed it, and 
	replaced it with easier-to-understand &quot;spell damage&quot;.&nbsp; Now, 
	the healing stat only 
	includes healing, and the spell damage stat only includes spell damage.<ul>
		<li>Now, Light&#39;s Justice, which says that it increases healing by 382 
		and damage by 128, has 382 healing and 128 spell damage, exactly as 
		you&#39;d expect.</li>
		<li>Pawn will automatically upgrade your existing scales and any scale 
		tags that you import.&nbsp; Please double-check the value of the spell 
		damage stat after importing to make sure that it&#39;s what you intended, 
		as in this version Pawn does not read your mind.&nbsp; 
		The upgrade process will give correct results for typical cases (DPS 
		casters who don&#39;t care about healing; healers who valued spell power at 
		least as high as healing, as they should have), but may not give the 
		results you expect if you had a strange scale (healing but no spell 
		power).</li>
		<li>As always, the default Pawn scale has been adjusted to accommodate 
		these changes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn enchanted has been added to let you turn off 
	the enchanted item values, showing only the unenchanted, unsocketed values 
	for items.&nbsp; (You can also use /pawn enchanted off along with /pawn 
	unenchanted off to temporarily hide all Pawn values.)&nbsp; This option may 
	not be compatible with all of your favorite tooltip mods, but it should work 
	in all cases where you currently get unenchanted item values today, which is 
	most everywhere.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button has a new, unique look, instead of being a regular red 
	WoW button.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button now appears in a more reasonable spot when the character 
	inventory window has been skinned using a mod such as Skinner.</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn button has been added to let you move the Pawn 
	button on the inventory window, or hide it completely.&nbsp; (If you hide 
	the button, you&#39;ll need to type /pawn to open the Pawn UI, or use the 
	Pawn plugin for FuBar or Titan Panel.)</li>
	<li>Added a new option to the /pawn asterisks slash command, /pawn asterisks 
	no text.&nbsp; Using this option is the same as /pawn asterisks auto, except 
	the &quot;* Pawn gave no value to some stats&quot; warning text is not added to 
	tooltips of items with at least one (*) unrecognized stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a button to the inventory window to show and hide the Pawn 
	configuration UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports Armory and EquipCompare working together with the &quot;/eqc 
	alt&quot; option to show comparisons with your alt&#39;s gear instead of your current 
	character&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Added support for the unusual items with negative stats, such as Kreeg&#39;s 
	Mug, which gives -10 Intellect.</li>
	<li>Added support for Braided Eternium Chain and other non-weapon items with 
	weapon damage as an equip bonus.&nbsp; It shows up as minimum damage and 
	maximum damage, but not DPS—it&#39;s not a weapon, so there&#39;s no speed, and 
	therefore no DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that would frequently show up when using Pawn with 
	CowTip, causing an error message to appear in chat when hovering over an 
	item and then an empty inventory slot.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes an open item link window would not be 
	immediately updated upon making scale changes.</li>
	<li>Minor changes to fix some issues when running a German version of Pawn 
	on the German WoW client.</li>
	<li>Updated the samples scales document with newer versions of Emmerald&#39;s 
	feral combat models and ShadowPanther&#39;s AEP model, and added scales for 
	Malan&#39;s Elitist Jerks EP for shamans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The special weapon DPS stats now work.&nbsp; I had broken them in either 
	0.7 or 0.7.1.&nbsp; Existing scales will automatically be corrected; you 
	should not need to re-enter values for those stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If the item link window is open when you make changes to your Pawn 
	scales, it will now be updated immediately, so you can see how your changes 
	will affect the value of the item.</li>
	<li>Added spell hit rating and spell crit rating to the configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	(Oops!)</li>
	<li>Corrected a typo in the description of the melee and ranged crit rating 
	stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now has a configuration UI!&nbsp; To access it, simply type /pawn 
	in the chat box.&nbsp; (To see the help information that used to be 
	available when you typed /pawn, type /pawn help, or click the /pawn commands 
	button in the configuration UI.)&nbsp; You should no longer need to manually edit your SavedVariables files 
		to configure Pawn.</li>
		<li>The configuration UI is now the official way to make all changes to 
		your Pawn scales.&nbsp; Some of the slash commands that existed in 
		earlier versions of Pawn are gone, since they&#39;re no longer needed: /pawn 
		list, export, import, delete, rename.</li>
	<li>Eliminated that bug where sometimes unenchanted values would 
	disappear from items after a while.&nbsp; The problem seemed to be most 
	commonly linked to use of the world map, but also could occur after zoning 
	or showing the interface options window.</li>
	<li>Scales now appear in alphabetical order on item tooltips.</li>
	<li>Pawn now works with tekKompare and LootLink.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of resilience rating in the default Pawn 
	value scale was 0 instead of 1 as was intended.&nbsp; Scale tags that call resilience rating &quot;Resilience&quot; instead of &quot;ResilienceRating&quot; 
	will now be imported properly.</li>
	<li>The value of ArmorPenetration in the default Pawn value scale is now 
	0.1, based on the latest information on WoWWiki.</li>
	<li>Includes VgerCore 1.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items in the guild bank vault.</li>
	<li>In <i>some</i> cases, you can use mods that create fake item tooltips 
	like AtlasLoot and ItemSync along with mods that mangle item tooltips like 
	Rating Buster, and Pawn will now still work.&nbsp; No guarantees that your 
	favorite combination of mods won&#39;t break Pawn, but this should help a lot of 
	people out.</li>
	<li>Finally fixed that bug where items with both durability and an Equip: or 
	Use: line that Pawn didn&#39;t understand would get asterisks on the wrong 
	lines.&nbsp; (For example, Stalker&#39;s Helm of Second Sight has this problem.)</li>
	<li>Added the /pawn space command, which adds a blank space before the item 
	values it adds to tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added a special &quot;stat&quot; called SpeedBaseline.&nbsp; SpeedBaseline isn&#39;t an 
	actual item property, but rather a number to be subtracted from weapon 
	speeds before they&#39;re multiplied by your scale values.&nbsp; For example, if 
	you&#39;re an enhancement shaman who wants to give weapons 1 point for every 0.1 
	second of speed slower than 2.9, use Speed = 10 (1 / 0.1) and SpeedBaseline 
	= 2.9.&nbsp; Weapons slower than 2.9 would instead lose points at the same rate.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of the FeralAp stat in the Pawn default scale from 
	0.5 to 0.4 so that feral items in 2.3 will have roughly the same values as 
	they did in 2.2 with the old Pawn default scale and so that the Pawn default 
	scale still roughly mimics item budget formulas.&nbsp; I do not necessarily 
	recommend that you change values in your own scales; your items have been 
	buffed, so it makes sense for their values to go up.</li>
	<li>Weapon skill rating stats have been removed from Pawn and the default 
	Pawn scale, as they&#39;ve been removed from the game in the patch.&nbsp; 
	Existing scales will not be automatically updated to use ExpertiseRating.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn values to gems in the socketing UI.</li>
	<li>Fixed the amount of healing and spell damage received from Teardrop 
	Tourmaline and possibly other gems that previously only gave healing.</li>
	<li>Added support for the new Chaotic Skyfire Diamond.</li>
	<li>Now displays a more readable error message when the embedded mod 
	VgerCore is missing or failed to load.</li>
	<li>Fixed several problems introduced in 2.3:<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 due to the new way that set item 
	tooltips look where Pawn was putting asterisks all over the name of the set, 
	the items in the set, and the set bonuses.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 where stats on meta gems weren&#39;t 
	always being counted due to requirements now being displayed on gems even 
	when socketed.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that appeared in 2.3 only where certain gems and random item 
	properties would appear very strange, such as &quot;+45 Stamina|cfff1a1a1a&quot;, and 
	Pawn would not understand them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a script error that appeared the first time a recipe was clicked 
	since logging in or resetting your UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now includes VgerCore 1.0 embedded within the mod; you don&#39;t need a 
	separate VgerCore folder in your AddOns folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports the 2.2.x live realms and the 2.3 PTRs.&nbsp; 
	(Healing-to-spell-damage and expertise require 2.3, of course.)</li>
	<li>Support for the healing to spell damage conversion.&nbsp; Items that say 
	that they increase healing by 300 and spell damage by 100 will be reported 
	as Healing = 200, SpellPower = 100.&nbsp; Recall that SpellPower <i>includes</i> 
	healing, thus your scale&#39;s value for SpellPower should always be equal to or 
	greater than the value for Healing.</li>
	<li>A new value of .255 was picked for the value of Healing in the default 
	scale, down from .455.&nbsp; With this value, items that had 1/3 of their 
	Healing converted to SpellPower (default value .855) in 2.3 will have the exact 
	same values in 2.3 that they did with the old scale in 2.2 (ignoring rounding errors).&nbsp; Of 
	course, you can and should customize your Pawn scales to fit your needs; 
	generally, healers should <i>not </i>adjust their scales to deal with this 
	change.</li>
	<li>Support for the new ExpertiseRating stat, valued at 1 in the 
	default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale, same as the existing weapon skill 
	stats.&nbsp; Existing scales will not be adjusted to include this stat.&nbsp; 
	If you haven&#39;t customized your scales and want to reset them, use /pawn resetscales.<ul>
		<li>Weapon skill ratings are currently still supported so you can use 
		Pawn 0.6.1 on the live realms too.&nbsp; They&#39;ll be removed in a later 
		version.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Support for many more healing enchantments, inscriptions, spellthread, 
	and so forth.</li>
	<li>Craftable items for which you can learn recipes from trainers will now 
	get Pawn values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in beta 1 where Pawn would display 
	an error message in the chat window whenever hovering over a ring with 
	Enchant Ring - Weapon Might.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to customize the colors that your scales will use when 
	printed.&nbsp; For example, you could have your DPS value show up in orange, 
	and your healing value show up in green.&nbsp; This is an advanced feature 
	that probably will never get its own UI or slash command.&nbsp; See the 
	section titled &quot;Changing the color of a scale&quot; for more information.</li>
	<li>Importing a scale tag that has the exact same name as a scale you 
	already have will update the old scale to match the values in the scale tag.&nbsp; 
	All of the values in the old scale will be deleted.&nbsp; (In previous 
	versions, Pawn would just fail and warn you that you can&#39;t overwrite an 
	existing scale.&nbsp; There is no longer a warning.)</li>
	<li>Weapon stats have been overhauled!&nbsp; Old scales will work, but now 
	advanced users have a variety of new options for assigning values to 
	weapons.</li>
	<li>New stats: MeleeMinDamage, MeleeMaxDamage, MeleeSpeed, MeleeDps, 
	MainHandMinDamage, MainHandMaxDamage, MainHandSpeed, MainHandDps, 
	OffHandMinDamage, OffHandMaxDamage, OffHandSpeed, OffHandDps, 
	OneHandMinDamage, OneHandMaxDamage, OneHandSpeed, OneHandDps, 
	TwoHandMinDamage, TwoHandMaxDamage, TwoHandSpeed, TwoHandDps, 
	RangedMinDamage, RangedMaxDamage, RangedSpeed, RangedDps.&nbsp; Generally, 
	you&#39;ll only use a few of these, and not give values to all of them.</li>
	<li>New stats: MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t care about 
	which slot or weapon type it is, just use MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed, 
	and/or Dps.&nbsp; Dps is now calculated to full precision (say, 41.333 
	instead of 41.3) instead of rounded to one decimal place.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon damage enchantments (Striking and Impact).</li>
	<li>Added support for ranged weapon scopes.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where certain items with suffixes would show unusually low unenchanted
	values (their stats would be read as 0).  For example, Chimaerascale Legguards of the Bandit
	exhibited this problem.</li>
	<li>Added support for Black Morass instance-bound items (beacons).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for haste rating and spell haste rating, which were added as passive
	item bonuses on Black Temple equipment.  (Iron Counterweight is also supported.)  These two
	stats (HasteRating, SpellHasteRating) are valued at 1 each on the default Pawn scale; existing
	Pawn scales won't be affected.  Use /pawn resetscales to delete all of your scales and replace them
	with the default one.</li>
	<li>Added support for armor penetration ("Your attacks ignore X of your opponent's armor").
	This stat (ArmorPenetration) is not valued in the default Pawn scale.</li>
	<li>Added support for Karazhan, Stratholme, and Tempest Keep instance-bound items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new gold profession recipe links in WoW 2.1.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn won&#39;t try to read them or put asterisks all over them.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added working support for the Savagery weapon enchantment, and untested support
	for Potency, Soulfrost, and Sunfire.</li>
	<li>Added support for EquipCompare 2.10.&nbsp; (This may break compatibility 
	with older versions of EquipCompare; please use the latest version.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW patch 2.1.</li>
	<li>Added support for Blizzard&#39;s new Currently Equipped functionality 
	(shift-hover an item).</li>
	<li>LinkWrangler support.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where stats in certain situations (gems with multiple stats 
	on one gem, socket bonuses, etc.) wouldn&#39;t get shown in the /pawn debug on 
	output.&nbsp; This did not affect calculation; it was just a debug display error.</li>
	<li>Expanded the amount of information Pawn returns in the debug output.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Vitality.</li>
	<li>Slightly updated a few of the default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale&#39;s numbers.&nbsp; 
	This will not affect existing scales, even if you haven&#39;t changed any of the 
	defaults.&nbsp; If you want to get the new scale, you can wipe out your 
	existing scale(s) with /pawn resetscales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Requires VgerCore 0.4.  (This is included with the mod.  Pawn will warn you if you
	are using an older version of VgerCore.)</li>
	<li>Pawn can now show unenchanted values for items in addition to the 
	regular enchanted values, and this is enabled by default.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it off with /pawn unenchanted off.&nbsp; This feature only works for real 
	tooltips, and not fake tooltips from an item database mod.</li>
	<li>Added an option to control the number of digits of precision Pawn uses 
	to display item values in tooltips.&nbsp; By default this is 1 (&quot;3.1&quot;), but 
	you can set it to any number between 0 (&quot;3&quot;) and 4 (&quot;3.1416&quot;) with /pawn 
	digits #.</li>
	<li>Corrected the value of frost resistance in the default Pawn scale to 1 
	(was 4).</li>
	<li>Pawn scale tags now have spaces inside of the parentheses by default.&nbsp; 
	This is to prevent certain scale tags from turning into emoticons when 
	posted to certain forums.&nbsp; (For example, if your scale tag ended in &quot;RedSocket=8)&quot;, 
	the 8) would turn into an emoticon on certain forums.)&nbsp; Old and current 
	versions of Pawn will accept the scale with or without the extra spaces. </li>
	<li>Lots of work was done to prepare for Pawn translations into other languages.&nbsp; 
	I may have made a mistake in this conversion and introduced cases where (*) 
	shows up where they didn&#39;t before; hopefully not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for gun, bow, and crossbow skill ratings.</li>
	<li>Added support for MultiTips.</li>
	<li>Added support for items that list stats as &quot;Stat +X&quot; instead of &quot;+X 
	Stat&quot;, namely the epic gems.&nbsp; Gems that only provided primary stats, 
	such as Seer&#39;s Chrysoprase, already worked, but others such as Rune Covered 
	Chrysoprase didn&#39;t work until this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added scale tags!&nbsp; Scale tags are chunks of text that you can use 
	to share Pawn scales with friends, guildmates, and others on forums, similar 
	to how you can share talent specs today by passing around a link to the WoW 
	talent calculator.&nbsp; You can copy a scale tag and then post it on your 
	guild forums, and then another player can copy that tag and paste it into 
	their game to automatically add your scale to their copy of Pawn, without 
	logging out of the game or changing files in Notepad.&nbsp; To export a 
	scale tag so you can share it with others, use the /pawn export command.&nbsp; 
	To import someone else&#39;s scale tag and add it to your own scales, use the 
	/pawn import command.</li>
	<li>Added new slash commands: /pawn list, export, import, delete, and 
	rename.&nbsp; See &quot;Slash commands&quot; in Readme.htm for more details.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon skill ratings (including unarmed and feral 
	combat).&nbsp; (They have been added to the default Pawn scale, but if you 
	care about weapon skill ratings you must add them to your custom scales 
	manually.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the /pawn resetscales command so that it would delete all of your 
	scales before recreating the default one named Pawn value, as was intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hovering over an enchanted Item X immediately after hovering over an 
	unenchanted Item X will now recalculate the values for the second item 
	instead of just displaying the ones for the first item.&nbsp; This should 
	work for all pairs of items that differ only by enchantments and gems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To read statistics, Pawn now makes a copy of the tooltip and reads from 
	that whenever possible, which allows it to read tooltips that have been 
	mangled by other mods.&nbsp; Examples of mods that do this are Mendeleev and 
	Rating Buster.&nbsp; (Certain mods that use custom tooltips, such as 
	ItemSync, don&#39;t support this; Pawn may still conflict with mods that modify 
	those custom tooltips.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ItemSync support, including using ItemSync with AtlasLoot.&nbsp; Pawn 
	will calculate and display values for ItemSync&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>EQCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EQCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>Item level display should work just about everywhere now, instead of 
	just in certain places.&nbsp; (In previous versions, it worked for inventory 
	items, but not chat item links.&nbsp; Now it works on both.)</li>
	<li>A new option has been added to display the item ID for items you come 
	across, /pawn ids on.</li>
	<li>The default is now to hide the asterisks (*) from items that don&#39;t have 
	any values for any of your scales.&nbsp; So, for example, Hearthstone and 
	potions won&#39;t display the asterisk.&nbsp; You can change this behavior using 
	/pawn asterisks [ on | auto | off ].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem in 0.2 where Pawn wouldn&#39;t work if you&#39;d never used 
	version 0.1 before.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>EquipCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EquipCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>AtlasLoot support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	instance drops when Atlas and AtlasLoot are installed.</li>
	<li>Outfitter support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the lines 
	that Outfitter adds to tooltips of items used in one or more gear sets.</li>
	<li>MonkeyQuest support.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t actually observed it happening in 
	the past, but this change should prevent MonkeyQuest&#39;s item tooltip 
	annotations from affecting Pawn.</li>
	<li>MobInfo-2 support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the drop rate 
	information that MobInfo-2 adds to items.&nbsp; (This problem manifested 
	itself both as unnecessary asterisks added to tooltips, and also as an 
	&quot;attempted to concatenate a nil value&quot; error.)</li>
	<li>Added APIs to create and change Pawn scales while you&#39;re still logged 
	in.&nbsp; These will eventually be used to build a configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	If you <i>really</i> want to, you can use them from the chat box to change 
	Pawn scales while logged into the game.</li>
	<li>Included a new file "Sample scales.htm" containing (you guessed it) some
