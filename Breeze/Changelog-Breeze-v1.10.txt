	- We load with Blizzard_GarrisonUI now, thanks Kyle! We register to GARRISON_MISSION_COMPLETE_RESPONSE instead of using a securehook We can now peacefully coexist with Master Plan. Holding Alt while clicking the "view completed missions" button will skip the boring battle animations while keeping everything else.
