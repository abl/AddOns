= GarrisonCommander helps you when choosing the right follower for the right mission =

== Description ==
GarrisonCommander adds to mission tooltips the following informations:
* makes mission panel movable (position NOT yet saved between sessions)
* base success chance (does NOT account for followers)
* list of follower that have the necessary counters for the mission, with their status (on mission, available etc)
* both traits (silver lines) and abilities(blue lines) are shown
* every follower line has now the icon for countered trait/ability
* time left shown for In mission follower
* possible party and success chance with that party

== Future plans ==
# Improving selection of followers for missions
