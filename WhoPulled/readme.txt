If there's one thing pugs commonly hate it's probably those griefers
that decide to pull the boss on their team when they leave (usually
because they wiped once, HOLY CRAP it's a freaking pug ._.). Anyway
after someone did it to me with Onyxia (who you can't really run from),
now that my gear costs me like 10g to repair per death, I got pissed
enough to make this addon. I don't know who it was that pulled and
that was what pissed me off the most. So now, I will always know who
the jackass is, and I can not only alert everyone to who it is, but
remember who and why I hate them, and never have to raid with them again.

Back story aside. This is an addon that tells you who pulled the boss
(or any mob in the instance) no matter how they pull it, even if they
do it with a pet. There are many surrounding features as well:

 * Notifies you of any pull and who it was by.
 * Allows you to recite the most recent pull, or the pull of a specific
   enemy to say, yell, party, raid, battleground (AV), or notify with
   a quick command.
 * Can filter out pull notifications based on who's tanking.
 * Can filter out pull notifications based on mob names (ie. Risen Zombie)
 * Has a maintainable RAGE list of people who pulled stuff on you and you
   decided to remember them.
 * Silent mode for when the notifications are bugging you.
 * Optional automatic yelling the name of the puller when someone other
   than the given tanks pull the boss.
 * In-game help file with /wp help An example of /wp help [topic] for
   those confused would be /wp help silent or /wp help ywho
 * Automatically adds tank whether in LFD group or in raid when marked as MainTank.
    If for some reason it doesn't recognize the tank, type /wp tanks
 * Removes tank from the list when demoted from MainTank.


Thanks to Aierre for making me fall in love with this addon enough that I can't
live without it - qod
