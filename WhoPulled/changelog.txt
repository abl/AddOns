--------------------------------------------------

V1.0 Release
* Fixed global 'this' issue caused by patch 4.0.1.
* Fixed cross-server issues.
* Added code for automatic MainTank detection in raid groups.
* Added automatic tank detection in LFD groups. No need to use /wp tanks Tanker-Servername anymore, though that command is still there and still adds anyone marked as tank to the list with whoever you say is tanking.
* Changed format of tanks. Using the example from above, they can be added with or without the spaces between name and server, as long as the dash is there.
/wp tanks Panzer,Steam-Khaz Modan,Sideswiper
OR
/wp tanks Panzer Steam - Khaz Modan Sideswiper
It will still recognize Panzer, Sideswiper, and Steam - Khaz Modan
