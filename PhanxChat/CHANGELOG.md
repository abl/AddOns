### Version 3.3.5.94

**Due to file changes, you should completely uninstall your existing copy of the addon before installing this version. Removing your old saved variables is recommended, but not required.**

* Added a Shorten Player Names feature, which shortens player names by removing realm names from cross-realm players and last names from Real ID players.
* Removed the Auto Start Chat Log feature, because I never used it.
* Removed the Color Player Names feature, because it was just too much code and performance overhead to color the very few types of messages that the default UI doesn't already color, and also confused all the <insert uncomplimentary adjective here> people who never read patch notes or change logs.

* **Translations are needed for all locales.**
* All existing translations for the configuration UI have been discarded, since none of them had been updated since the transition from slash commands to a GUI over a year ago. If you can provide translations for any locale, please send me a PM.
* Additionally, several chat channels are currently only shortened in English locales, because nobody has provided translations for them. If you see a channel name that isn't shortened, please post a bug report ticket with your locale (eg. "German" or "deDE"), the English name of the channel (eg. "General"), the localized name of the channel (eg. "Allgemein"), and an appropriate short form for your locale (eg. "A").

* Removed the “Enable mousewheel scrolling” option, since this functionality is now provided by the default UI.
* Modified the default UI's mousewheel scrolling to scroll more lines at a time, page up/down on ctrl, and top/bottom on shift.
* Fixed a bug preventing custom short channel name formats from using the channel name in addition to the channel number.
* Translations are needed for the new options in all locales. Also, major revisions are needed for several locales. If you can assist with translations for any locale, please send me a PM.
