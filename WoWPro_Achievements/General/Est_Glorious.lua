N Glorious!|N|This guide will give you the rough position of every rare mob in Pandaria so that you can check their locations every so often to see if they are there. Because as their name implies, they are RARE.|
N Patch Notes|N|This guide will only cover the Rares of 5.0, there are more guides planned for those added in later patches once I get around to write them ;)|
N Some may already be completed|N|This guide keeps track of the rares by checking which steps of the achievement you have already completed and won't show those that you already got. Because of this, the path from Mob to Mob might seem illogical at times as it is optimized for players who have not met any of them yet.|
N General info on the mobs|N|There are 8 different types of rares, one of each type in every Pandaria Zone: Hozen, Jinyu, Mantid, Mogu Sorcerer, Mogu Warrior, Pandaren, Saurok and Yaungol. They vary in level by zone, starting at level 85 and cap out at level 91. All of them have approximatly a 1 hour respawn time.|
N General advice on the fights|N|Their auto attacks do little damage (around 5k), so one of the best tactics, even for ranged dps, can be to stay in melee in order to avoid their stronger ranged attacks (There is one exception though, which the guide will mention in time). Be ready to heal if you start taking any of their special attacks as more than one will likely kill you. |
N More general advice|N|If you know some armed friendly NPCs in the area (like guards), try kiting the mob to them, they will often join in to help. Lastly, all mobs of a type have the same set of abilities, so if you mastered how to fight a Jinyu rare, you can fight ALL Jinyu rares with the same tactics.|

R Sele'na|T|Sele'na|ACH|7439;9|N|The Jinyu can be found in several locations in the Gilded Fan, the marshes north of Halfhill, Valley of the Four Winds. Just fly once around the area and spam the targetting macro (this holds true for all rares in this guide with multiple waypoints). JINYU TACTICS: Ignore his "Water Bolt", save your interrupts/stuns for when he starts to cast "Torrent" which is quite deadly. For his channeled spell "Rain Dance", he throws out blobs of water in the area around him, run away from them to avoid the damage.|Z|Valley of the Four Winds|M|57.8,33.4;59.6,38.4;54.6,36.6;52.8,28.6|CS|
R Sulik'shor|T|Sulik'shor|ACH|7439;23|N|A mogu sorcerer who can be found near the western shore of Cattail Lake, Valley of the Four Winds. MOGU SORCERER TACTICS: Ignore his "Dark Bolt", a simple ranged attack, nothing to be done about it. "Shadow Bolt" can be interrupted although it's not a strong attack. "Voidcloud" creates an AoE zone on your location when the spell finishes. Move out of it quickly, actually try to be moving already when the cast is ending and place it in an area you can stay out of. Voidclouds last long enough that you may have 2 or 3 up at the same time.|Z|Valley of the Four Winds|M|37.0,25.6|

R Major Nanners|T|Major Nanners|ACH|7439;7|N|A Hozen on the shore of the lake southwest and above Mistfall Village, Vale of Eternal Blossoms. HOZEN TACTICS: "Bananarang" is lethal if it strikes you, strafe to one side while he's casting it. It will come back to him so stay out of its path. "Toss Filth", a stacking damage debuff, can be trouble if it gets too high, but should have time to reset during "Going Bananas", the most dangerous ability: He will leap around wildly causing massive damage if he lands on you. He moves really fast, so surviving this attack depends on luck or your defensive cooldowns. It's best to fight in a large, open area to give him more room to jump around, decreasing the chances he'll land on you.|Z|Vale of Eternal Blossoms|M|31.6,91.6|
R Ai-Ran the Shifting Cloud|T|Ai-Ran the Shifting Cloud|ACH|7439;42|N|A Pandaren in a cave unerneath the Tu Shen Burial Grounds, Vale of Eternal Blossoms. PANDAREN TACTICS: "Spinning Crane Kick": run away or stun him. Save your interrupt for "Healing Mists" which heals him for a huge amount. "Chi Burst" hits quite hard but he only uses it if his target is not within melee range, so stay close to him except for his spinning attack.|Z|Vale of Eternal Blossoms|M|42.6,69.0|
R Moldo One-Eye|T|Moldo One-Eye|ACH|7439;49|N|This Saurok patrols the eastern shore of Whitepetal Lake and the river south of it, Vale of Eternal Blossoms. SAUROK TACTICS: "Vicious Rend" is a stacking DoT you will have to endure. The main danger of Saurok is their ability "Vanish", which is followed by a deadly attack called "Smoked Blade" if successful. "Vanish" should be interrupted. If you fail, you can also try to run far away, for he will use "Grappling Hook" on players more than 20 yards away, which might break his stealth, preventing "Smoked Blade" if the timing is right.|Z|Vale of Eternal Blossoms|M|33.8,66.0;43.5,48.1|CS|
R Urgolax|T|Urgolax|ACH|7439;35|N|A Mogu Warrior on the Golden Stair, Vale of Eternal Blossoms. MOGU WARRIOR TACTICS: He summons a Quilen add with low health and minor damage, can be killed or CCed. The mogu occasionally gets "Titanic Strength", a stacking damage buff, so don't take too long in bringing him down. Watch out for his "Devastating Arc" which will smash everything in a 180 degrees cone in front of him, so if you see the ground trembling, quickly run behind him.|Z|Vale of Eternal Blossoms|M|39.8,25.0|

R Korda Torros|T|Korda Torros|ACH|7439;53|N|A yaungol patrolling through Fire Camp Ordo, Kun-Lai Summit. YAUNGOL TACTICS: Unlike all the other rare mobs, a Yaungol is more dangerous if you stay too close to him. He will aternate between an AoE Stomp wich does heavy damage around him and an enrage which will reduce his walking speed but heavily increase his melee damage for a short time. Try to kite him around while damaging him, which can be quite hard for melee players. Don't get TOO far away from him though, or he will charge you!|Z|Kun-Lai Summit|M|47.4,81.2;51.6,80.8|CS|
R Scritch|T|Scritch|ACH|7439;4|N|This Hozen appears in one of the four small caves around the Dooker Dome, Kun-Lai Summit. HOZEN TACTICS: "Bananarang" is lethal if it strikes you, strafe to one side while he's casting it. It will come back to him so stay out of its path.

The mogu occasionally gets "Titanic Strength", a stacking damage buff, so don't take too long in bringing him down. Watch out for his "Devastating Arc" which will smash everything in a 180 degrees cone in front of him, so if you see the ground trembling, quickly run behind him.|Z|Kun-Lai Summit|M|57.0,76.0;59.2,73.8|CS|
R Zai the Outcast|T|Zai the Outcast|ACH|7439;11|N|This Jinyu appears in several of the buildings in the northern part of the Jinyu village near Inkgill Mere, Kun-Lai Summit. JINYU TACTICS: Ignore his "Water Bolt", save your interrupts/stuns for when he starts to cast "Torrent" which is quite deadly. For his channeled spell "Rain Dance", he throws out blobs of water in the area around him, run away from them to avoid the damage.|Z|Kun-Lai Summit|M|74.4,79.2;73.8,77.4;73.2,76.4|CS|
R Nessos the Oracle|T|Nessos the Oracle|ACH|7439;46|N|The northernmost Rare in Panaria is this Saurok on an island off the coast of Zouchin Village, Kun-Lai-Summit. SAUROK TACTICS: "Vicious Rend" is a stacking DoT you will have to endure. The main danger of Saurok is their ability "Vanish", which is followed by a deadly attack called "Smoked Blade" if successful. "Vanish" should be interrupted. If you fail, you can also try to run far away, for he will use "Grappling Hook" on players more than 20 yards away, which might break his stealth, preventing "Smoked Blade" if the timing is right.|Z|Kun-Lai Summit|M|63.8,13.8|
R Borginn Darkfist|T|Borginn Darkfist|ACH|7439;25|N|This Mogu Sorcerer can be found in the Valley of Emperors, Kun-Lai Summit. Try killing the Mobs in the area before pulling him. MOGU SORCERER TACTICS: Ignore his "Dark Bolt", a simple ranged attack, nothing to be done about it. "Shadow Bolt" can be interrupted although it's not a strong attack. "Voidcloud" creates an AoE zone on your location when the spell finishes.

R Kah'tir|T|Kah'tir|ACH|7439;33|N|A Mogu Warrior at the back of the camp of elite mogus at the western end of the Great Wall, Townlong Steppes. MOGU WARRIOR TACTICS: He summons a Quilen add with low health and minor damage, can be killed or CCed. The mogu occasionally gets "Titanic Strength", a stacking damage buff, so don't take too long in bringing him down. Watch out for his "Devastating Arc" which will smash everything in a 180 degrees cone in front of him, so if you see the ground trembling, quickly run behind him.|Z|Townlong Steppes|M|63.0,35.6|

MANTID TACTICS: "Blade Flurry" deals heavy damage in front of the Mantid, run away or stun him if you can. "Windsong" prevents him from being snared or rooted, so no kiting is possible.

R Arness the Scale|T|Arness the Scale|ACH|7439;45|N|The Saurok can be found on a pile of gold on the triangle-shaped piece of land protruding from the coast south of the Ruins of Dojan. SAUROK TACTICS: "Vicious Rend" is a stacking DoT you will have to endure. The main danger of Saurok is their ability "Vanish", which is followed by a deadly attack called "Smoked Blade" if successful. "Vanish" should be interrupted. If you fail, you can also try to run far away, for he will use "Grappling Hook" on players more than 20 yards away, which might break his stealth, preventing "Smoked Blade" if the timing is right.|Z|Krasarang Wilds|M|56.2,46.8|
R Gaarn the Toxic|T|Gaarn the Toxic|ACH|7439;24|N|A Mogu Sorcerer who appears in several locations in the Ruins of Dojan, Krasarang Wilds. MOGU SORCERER TACTICS: Ignore his "Dark Bolt", a simple ranged attack, nothing to be done about it. "Shadow Bolt" can be interrupted although it's not a strong attack. "Voidcloud" creates an AoE zone on your location when the spell finishes. Move out of it quickly, actually try to be moving already when the cast is ending and place it in an area you can stay out of. Voidclouds last long enough that you may have 2 or 3 up at the same time.|Z|Krasarang Wilds|M|53.6,38.8;56.2,38.2;54.0,32.2|CS|
R Qu'nas|T|Qu'nas|ACH|7439;31|N|This Mogu Warrior stands guard over the Krasari Ruins, Krasarang Wilds. MOGU WARRIOR TACTICS: He summons a Quilen add with low health and minor damage, can be killed or CCed. The mogu occasionally gets "Titanic Strength", a stacking damage buff, so don't take too long in bringing him down. Watch out for his "Devastating Arc" which will smash everything in a 180 degrees cone in front of him, so if you see the ground trembling, quickly run behind him.|Z|Krasarang Wilds|M|67.2,23.0|

R Salyin Warscout|T|Salyin Warscout|ACH|7439;44|N|A scout from the raiding party that rides atop the World Boss Galleon, this Saurok patrols along the Yan-Zhe River west of the Silken Fields, Valley of the Four Winds.

PANDAREN TACTICS: "Spinning Crane Kick": run away or stun her. Save your interrupt for "Healing Mists" which heals her for a huge amount. "Chi Burst" hits quite hard but she only uses it if her target is not within melee range, so stay close to her except for her spinning attack.|Z|Valley of the Four Winds|M|88.6,18.0|

R Krax'ik|T|Krax'ik|ACH|7439;15|N|This Mantid seems to far out of their usual territory, he can be found on top of a cliff in the Thunderwood, Jade Forest. Look really closely, he is stealthed. MANTID TACTICS: "Blade Flurry" deals heavy damage in front of the Mantid, run away or stun him if you can. "Windsong" prevents him from being snared or rooted, so no kiting is possible. Lastly, he'll summon a "Tornado" which will move in circles and deal damage in an area around it, stay away!|Z|The Jade Forest|M|39.6,62.6|
R Kor'nas Nightsavage|T|Kor'nas Nightsavage|ACH|7439;22|N|A Mogu Sorcerer who patrols through the Nectarbreeze Orchard, Jade Forest. MOGU SORCERER TACTICS: Ignore his "Dark Bolt", a simple ranged attack, nothing to be done about it. "Shadow Bolt" can be interrupted although it's not a strong attack.

R Sarnak|T|Sarnak|ACH|7439;43|N|The easternmost Rare of Pandaria is this Saurok, hidden away in a cave near the coast in the Bamboo Wilds, Jade Forest.

R Ferdinand|T|Ferdinand|ACH|7439;50|N|This Yaungol can be found resting under several of the trees in the Arboretum, Jade Forest. YAUNGOL TACTICS: Unlike all the other rare mobs, a Yaungol is more dangerous if you stay too close to him. He will alternate between an AoE Stomp wich does heavy damage around him and an enrage which will reduce his walking speed but heavily increase his melee damage for a short time. Try to kite him around while damaging him, which can be quite hard for melee players. Don't get TOO far away from him though, or he will charge you!|Z|The Jade Forest|M|56.4,48.2;53.6,49.6;54.2,42.4;52.2,44.4|CS|

R Mister Ferocious|T|Mister Ferocious|ACH|7439;1|N|This Hozen is found sittig near the wreck of an overturned wagon in the Forest Heart, Jade Forest. HOZEN TACTICS: "Bananarang" is lethal if it strikes you, strafe to one side while he's casting it. It will come back to him so stay out of its path. "Toss Filth", a stacking damage debuff, can be trouble if it gets too high, but should have time to reset during "Going Bananas", the most dangerous ability: He will leap around wildly causing massive damage if he lands on you. He moves really fast, so surviving this attack depends on luck or your defensive cooldowns. It's best to fight in a large, open area to give him more room to jump around, decreasing the chances he'll land on you.|Z|The Jade Forest|M|42.6,38.8|
R Aethis|T|Aethis|ACH|7439;8|N|This Jinyu sits on a tiny island in a small pond east of Grookin Hill, Jade Forest. JINYU TACTICS: Ignore his "Water Bolt", save your interrupts/stuns for when he starts to cast "Torrent" which is quite deadly. For his channeled spell "Rain Dance", he throws out blobs of water in the area around him, run away from them to avoid the damage.|Z|The Jade Forest|M|33.6,50.8|
