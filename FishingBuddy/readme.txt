Fishing Buddy
-------------

 A fishing addon that keeps track of the fish you catch and helps manage your
 fishing gear.

 Features:
 - 'Fish Watcher' lets you see the fish you've caught here before (or the fish that you've caught in the current session)
 - Display your current skill level and the time since you started fishing
 - Choose your fishing outfit and change into it easily
 - Support for automatically adding a lure to your fishing pole
 - Full Titan Panel support
 - myAddOns support
 - Preliminary support for tracking 'cycle fish' such as the Nightfin
   Snapper so you know when to go looking for them

 Example commands:
 /fishingbuddy or /fb
 toggle the display of the Fishing Buddy window
 /fb help
 print the list of Fishing Buddy commands 
 /fb switch
 wear your chosen fishing outfit, or change back

 Silly stuff:
 In addition to displaying the fishing bonus for your fishing outfit, it also displays your 'style points' as inferred from Draznar's Fishing FAQ (http://wow.toshimo.com/viewtopic.php?t=272).
