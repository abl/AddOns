-- Log: Hendo72 - Feb 12/2014
--	Made the following changes:
--	- Removed sticky missed earlier.
--	- Updated C step for 'The Lesson of Dry Fur'. Found a better way to do it.
--	- Changed the order in which you complete 'jumping pole' quests for better flow. Makes more sense to complete the pole quests before jumping down into the water.
--	- Added Fang-she to the 'Sun Pearl' note.
--	- Improved the 'Sting of Learning' C step and made it a sticky to be done while completing 'Sun Pearl'.
