N Valley of the Four Winds|QID|29907|N|Make your way to Valley of the Four Winds. Blizzard added a new UI Element called the Special Action button. If you don?t already have a keybinding set for it, you may want to, as some quests use it. Yes, you can just click it, but I think keybindings are easier, its similar to the idea of Vehicle UI, but your regular action bars don't go away, you just get a new button.|
