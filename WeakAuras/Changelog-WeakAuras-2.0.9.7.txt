--------------------

Infus:
	- Fix upgrading broken by multi-selecting talents change
	- Always initialize charges in WatchSpellCooldown
	Instead of only doing it if the ability is on cooldown, since that
	then meant that the WeakAuras.GetSpellCharges returned a wrong
	value until the ability was used.
	
	Ticket-Number: 147
	- Load options: Also merge class setting if multiple auras are selected
	With one aura selected the talent spec/talents load conditions show
	the specs/talents of the selected class. This didn't work if
	multiple classes where selected. This patch fixes this if all auras
	have the same class selected.
	- Multi select talents
	Patch by pnutbutter
	- Guard against nil custom text functions
	Ticket-number: 44
	- Fix another nil error in new layouting code
	This simplfies the code to immediately pick the display, so
	that it is guranteed to exist. The old code tried to also work
	in cases where we are still loading auras. This now doesn't work
	anymore, but the code is also much simpler.
	- Fix yOffset being nil error for invisible auras
